Alice continued to heal and to grow. She came down to the cookhouse with me for the first time on the day Carrie had her baby.

Alice had been with us for three weeks. She might have been twelve or thirteen mentally now. That morning, she had told Rufus she wanted to sleep in the attic with me. To my surprise, Rufus had agreed. He hadn’t wanted to, but he had done it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought, not for the first time, that if Alice could manage to go on not hating him, there would be very little she couldn’t ask of him. If.

Now, slowly, cautiously, she followed me down the stairs. She was weak and thinner than ever, looking like a child in one of Margaret Weylin’s old dresses. But boredom had driven her from her bed.

“I’ll be glad when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>get well,” she muttered as she paused on a step. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hate to be like this.”

“You’re getting well,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was a little ahead of her, watching to see that she did not stumble. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had taken her arm at the top of the stairs, but she had tried to pull away.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can walk.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>let her walk.

We got to the cookhouse just as Nigel did, but he was in a bigger hurry. We stood aside and let him rush through the door ahead of us.

“Huh!” said Alice as he went by. “’Scuse me!”

He ignored her. “Aunt Sarah,” he called, “Aunt Sarah, Carrie’s having pains!”

Old Mary had been the midwife of the plantation before her age caught up with her. Now, the Weylins may have expected her to go on doctoring the slaves, but the slaves knew better. They helped each other as best they could. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t seen Sarah called to help with a birth before, but it was natural that she should be called to this one. She dropped a pan of corn meal and started to follow Nigel out.

“Can <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>help?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked.

She looked at me as though she’d just noticed me. “See to the supper,” she said. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was going to send somebody in to finish cooking, but you can, can’t you?”

“Yes.”

“Good.” She and Nigel hurried away. Nigel had a cabin away from the quarter, not far from the cookhouse. A neat wood-floored brick-chimneyed cabin that he had built for himself and Carrie. He had shown it to me. “Don’t have to sleep on rags up in the attic no more,” he’d said. He’d built a bed and two chairs. Rufus had let him hire his time, work for other whites in the area, until he had money enough to buy the things he couldn’t make. It had been a good investment for Rufus. Not only did he get part of Nigel’s earnings, but he got the assurance that Nigel, his only valuable piece of property, was not likely to run away again soon.

“Can <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>go see?” Alice asked me.

“No,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said reluctantly. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted to go myself, but Sarah didn’t need either of us getting in her way. “No, you and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>have work to do here. Can you peel potatoes?”

“Sure.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat her down at the table and gave her a knife and some potatoes to peel. The scene reminded me of my own first time in the cookhouse when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had sat peeling potatoes until Kevin called me away. Kevin might have my letter by now. He almost surely did. He might already be on his way here.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shook my head and began cutting up a chicken. No sense tormenting myself.

“Mama used to make me cook,” said Alice. She frowned as though trying to remember. “She said I’d have to be cooking for my husband.” She frowned again, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>almost cut myself trying to watch her. What was she remembering?

“Dana?”

“Yes?”

“Don’t you have a husband? <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>remember once … something about you having a husband.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do. He’s up North now.”

“He free?”

“Yes.”

“Good to marry a freeman. Mama always said <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>should.”

Mama was right, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said nothing.

“My father was a slave, and they sold him away from her. She said marrying a slave is almost bad as being a slave.” She looked at me. “What’s it like to be a slave?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>managed not to look surprised. It hadn’t occurred to me that she didn’t realize she was a slave. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered how she had explained her presence here to herself.

“Dana?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at her.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said what’s it like to be a slave?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took a deep breath. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wonder how Carrie is doing—in all that pain, and not even able to scream.”

“How could you not know what it’s like to be a slave. You are one.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>haven’t been one for very long.”

“You were free?”

“Yes.”

“And you let yourself be made a slave? You should run away.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>glanced at the door. “Be careful how you say things like that. You could get into trouble.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt like Sarah, cautioning.

“Well it’s true.”

“Sometimes it’s better to keep the truth to yourself.”

She stared at me with concern. “What will happen to you?”

“Don’t worry about me, Alice. My husband will help me get free.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went to the door to look out toward Carrie’s cabin. Not that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>expected to see anything. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just wanted to distract Alice. She was getting too close, “growing” too fast. Her life would change so much for the worse when she remembered. She would be hurt more, and Rufus would do much of the hurting. And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have to watch and do nothing.

“Mama said she’d rather be dead than be a slave,” she said.

“Better to stay alive,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “At least while there’s a chance to get free.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought of the sleeping pills in my bag and wondered just how great a hypocrite <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was. It was so easy to advise other people to live with their pain.

Suddenly, she threw the potato she had been peeling into the fire.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>jumped, looked at her. “Why’d you do that?”

“There’s things you ain’t saying.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sighed.

“I’m here too,” she said. “Been here a long time.” She narrowed her eyes. “Am <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>a slave too?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t answer.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said am <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>a slave?”

“Yes.”

She had risen half off the bench, her whole body demanding that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>answer her. Now that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had, she sat down again heavily, her back and shoulders rounded, her arms crossed over her stomach hugging herself. “But I’m supposed to be free. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was free. Born free!”

“Yes.”

“Dana, tell me what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t remember. Tell me!”

“It will come back to you.”

“No, you tell—”

“Oh, hush, will you!”

She drew back a little in surprise. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had shouted at her. She probably thought <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was angry—and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was. But not at her. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted to pull her back from the edge of a cliff. It was too late though. She would have to take her fall.

“I’ll tell you whatever you want to know,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said wearily. “But believe me, you don’t want to know as much as you think you do.”

“Yes <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sighed. “All right. What do you want to know?”

She opened her mouth, then frowned and closed it again. Finally, “There’s so much … <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>want to know everything, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know where to start. Why am <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>a slave?”

“You committed a crime.”

“A crime? What’d <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do?”

“You helped a slave to escape.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>paused. “Do you realize that in all the time you’ve been here, you never asked me how you were hurt?”

That seemed to touch something in her. She sat blank-faced for several seconds, then frowned and stood up. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>watched her carefully. If she was going to have hysterics, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted her to have them where she was, out of sight of the Weylins. There were too many things she could say that Tom Weylin in particular would resent.

“They beat me,” she whispered. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>remember. The dogs, the rope … They tied me behind a horse and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to run, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t … Then they beat me … But … but …”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>walked over to her, stood in front of her, but she seemed to look through me. She had that same look of pain and confusion she’d had when Rufus brought her from town.

“Alice?”

She seemed not to hear me. “Isaac?” she whispered. But it was more a soundless moving of her lips than a whisper. Then,

“Isaac!” An explosion of sound. She bolted for the door. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>let her take about three steps before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>grabbed her.

“Let go of me! Isaac! Isaac!”

“Alice, stop. You’ll make me hurt you.” She was struggling against me with all her feeble strength.

“They cut him! They cut off his ears!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been hoping she hadn’t seen that. “Alice!” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>held her by the shoulders and shook her.

“I’ve got to get away,” she wept. “Find Isaac.”

“Maybe. When you can walk more than ten steps without getting tired.”

She stopped her struggles, stared at me through streaming tears. “Where’d they send him?”

“Mississippi.”

“Oh Jesus …” She collapsed against me, crying. She would have fallen if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t held her and half-dragged and half-carried her back to the bench. She sat slumped where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>put her, crying, praying, cursing. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat with her for a while, but she didn’t tire, or at least, she didn’t stop. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to leave her to finish preparing supper. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was afraid <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would anger Weylin and get Sarah into trouble if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t. There would be trouble enough in the house now that Alice had her memory back, and somehow, it had become my job to ease troubles—first Rufus’s, now Alice’s—as best <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>finished the meal somehow, though my mind wasn’t on it. There was the soup that Sarah had left simmering; fish to fry; ham that had been rock-hard before Sarah soaked it, then boiled it; chicken to fry and corn bread and gravy to make; Alice’s forgotten potatoes to finish; bread to bake in the little brick oven alongside the fireplace; vegetables, including salad; a sugary peach dessert—Weylin raised peaches; a cake that Sarah had already made, thank God; and both coffee and tea. There would be company to help eat it all. There usually was. And they would all eat too much. It was no wonder the main medicines of this era were laxatives.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got the food ready, almost on time, then had to hunt down the two little boys whose job it was to ferry it from cookhouse to table and then serve it. When <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found them, they wasted some time staring at the now silent Alice, then they grumbled because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>made them wash. Finally, my washhouse friend Tess, who also worked in the main house, ran out and said, “Marse Tom say get food on the table!”

“Is the table set?”

“Been set! Even though you didn’t say nothin’.”

Oops. “I’m sorry, Tess. Here, help me out.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thrust a covered dish of soup into her hands. “Carrie is having her baby now and Sarah’s gone to help her. Take that in, would you?”

“And come back for more?”

“Please.”

She hurried away. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had helped her with the washing several times—had done as much of it as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could myself recently because Weylin had casually begun taking her to bed, and had hurt her. Apparently, she paid her debts.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went out to the well and got the boys just as they were starting a water fight.

“If you two don’t get yourselves into the house with that food …!”

“You sound just like Sarah.”

“No <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t. You know what she’d be saying. You know what she’d be doing too. Now move! Or I’ll get a switch and really be like her.”

Dinner was served. Somehow. And it was all edible. There may have been more of it if Sarah had been cooking, but it wouldn’t have tasted any better. Sarah had managed to overcome my uncertainty, my ignorance of cooking on an open hearth and teach me quite a bit.

As the meal progressed and the leftovers began to come back, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried to get Alice to eat. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>fixed her a plate but she pushed it away, turned her back to me.

She had sat either staring into space or resting her head on the table for hours. Now, finally, she spoke.

“Why didn’t you tell me?” she asked bitterly. “You could have said something, got me out of his room, his bed … Oh Lord, his bed! And he may as well have cut my Isaac’s ears off with his own hand.”

“He never told anyone Isaac beat him.”

“Shit!”

“It’s true. He never did because he didn’t want you to get hurt. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was with him until he got back on his feet. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took care of him.”

“If you had any sense, you would have let him die!”

“If <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had, it wouldn’t have kept you and Isaac from being caught. It might have gotten you both killed though if anyone guessed what Isaac had done.”

“Doctor-nigger,” she said with contempt. “Think you know so much. Reading-nigger. White-nigger! Why didn’t you know enough to let me die?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said nothing. She was getting angrier and angrier, shouting at me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned away from her sadly, telling myself it was better, safer for her to vent her feelings on me than on anyone else.

Along with her shouting now, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could hear the thin faint cries of a baby.





11


Carrie and Nigel named their thin, wrinkled, brown son, Jude. Nigel did a lot of strutting and happy babbling until Weylin told him to shut up and get back to work on the covered passageway he was supposed to be building to connect the house and the cookhouse. A few days after the baby’s birth, though, Weylin called him into the library and gave him a new dress for Carrie, a new blanket, and a new suit of clothes for himself.

“See,” Nigel told me later with some bitterness. “’Cause of Carrie and me, he’s one nigger richer.” But before the Weylins, he was properly grateful.

“Thank you, Marse Tom. Yes, sir. Sure do thank you. Fine clothes, yes, sir …”

Finally he escaped back to the covered passageway.

Meanwhile, in the library, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard Weylin tell Rufus, “You should have been the one to give him something—instead of wasting all your money on that worthless girl.”

“She’s well!” Rufus answered. “Dana got her well. Why do you say she’s worthless?”

“Because you’re going to have to whip her sick again to get what you want from her!”

Silence.

“Dana should have been enough for you. She’s got some sense.” He paused. “Too much sense for her own good, I’d say, but at least she wouldn’t give you trouble. She’s had that Franklin fellow to teach her a few things.”

Rufus walked away from him without answering. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to get away from the library door where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been eavesdropping very quickly as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard him approach. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ducked into the dining room and came out again just as he was passing by.

“Rufe.”

He gave me a look that said he didn’t want to be bothered, but he stopped anyway.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>want to write another letter.”

He frowned. “You’ve got to be patient, Dana. It hasn’t been that long.”

“It’s been over a month.”

“Well … <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know. Kevin could have moved again, could have done anything. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think you should give him a little more time to answer.”

“Answer what?” asked Weylin. He’d done what Rufus had predicted—come up behind us so silently that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t noticed him.

Rufus glanced at his father sourly. “Letter to Kevin Franklin telling him she’s here.”

“She wrote a letter?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told her to write it. Why should <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do it when she can?”

“Boy, you don’t have the sense you—” He cut off abruptly. “Dana, go do your work!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>left wondering whether Rufus had shown lack of sense by letting me write the letter—instead of writing it himself—or by sending it. After all, if Kevin never came back for me, Weylin’s property was increased by one more slave. Even if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>proved not to be very useful, he could always sell me.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shuddered. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to talk Rufus into letting me write another letter. The first one could have been lost or destroyed or sent to the wrong place. Things like that were still happening in 1976. How much worse might they be in this horse-and-buggy era? And surely Kevin would give up on me if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went home without him again—left him here for more long years. If he hadn’t already given up on me.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried to put that thought out of my mind. It came to me now and then even though everything people told me seemed to indicate that he was waiting. Still waiting.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went out to the laundry yard to help Tess. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had come to almost welcome the hard work. It kept me from thinking. White people thought <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was industrious. Most blacks thought <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was either stupid or too intent on pleasing the whites. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was keeping my fears and doubts at bay as best <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could, and managing to stay relatively sane.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>caught Rufus alone again the next day—in his room this time where we weren’t likely to be interrupted. But he wouldn’t listen when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>brought up the letter. His mind was on Alice. She was stronger now, and his patience with her was gone. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had thought that eventually, he would just rape her again—and again. In fact, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was surprised that he hadn’t already done it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t realize that he was planning to involve me in that rape. He was, and he did.

“Talk to her, Dana,” he said once he’d brushed aside the matter of my letter. “You’re older than she is. She thinks you know a lot. Talk to her!”

He was sitting on his bed staring into the cold fireplace. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat at his desk looking at the clear plastic pen <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had loaned him. He’d used half its ink already. “What the hell have you been writing with this?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked.

“Dana, listen to me!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned to face him. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard you.”

“Well?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t stop you from raping the woman, Rufe, but I’m not going to help you do it either.”

“You want her to get hurt?”

“Of course not. But you’ve already decided to hurt her, haven’t you?”

He didn’t answer.

“Let her go, Rufe. Hasn’t she suffered enough because of you?” He wouldn’t. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew he wouldn’t.

His green eyes glittered. “She’ll never get away from me again. Never!” He drew a deep breath, let it out slowly. “You know, Daddy wants me to send her to the fields and take you.”

“Does he?”

“He thinks all <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>want is a woman. Any woman. So you, then. He says you’d be less likely to give me trouble.”

“Do you believe him?”

He hesitated, managed to smile a little. “No.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>nodded. “Good.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know you, Dana. You want Kevin the way <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>want Alice. And you had more luck than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did because no matter what happens now, for a while he wanted you too. Maybe <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t ever have that—both wanting, both loving. But I’m not going to give up what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can have.”

“What do you mean, ‘no matter what happens now?’”

“What in hell do you think <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>mean? It’s been five years! You want to write another letter. Did you ever think maybe he threw the first letter out? Maybe he got like Alice—wanted to be with one of his own kind.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said nothing. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew what he was doing—trying to share his pain, hurt me as he was hurting. And of course, he knew just where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was vulnerable. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried to keep a neutral expression, but he went on.

“He told me once that you two had been married for four years. That means he’s been here away from you even longer than you’ve been together. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>doubt if he’d have waited as long as he did if you weren’t the only one who could get him back to his home time. But now … who knows. The right woman could make this time mighty sweet to him.”

“Rufe, nothing you say to me is going to ease your way with Alice.”

“No? How about this: You talk to her—talk some sense into her—or you’re going to watch while Jake Edwards beats some sense into her!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stared at him in revulsion. “Is that what you call love?”

He was on his feet and across the room to me before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could take another breath. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was, watching him, feeling frightened, and suddenly very much aware of my knife, of how quickly <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could reach it. He wasn’t going to beat me. Not him, not ever.

“Get up!” he ordered. He didn’t order me around much, and he’d never done it in that tone. “Get up, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t move.

“I’ve been too easy on you,” he said. His voice was suddenly low and ugly. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>treated you like you were better than the ordinary niggers. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>see <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>made a mistake!”

“That’s possible,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “I’m waiting for you to show me <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>made a mistake.”

For several seconds, he stood frozen, towering over me, glaring down as though he meant to hit me. Finally, though, he relaxed, leaned against his desk. “You think you’re white!” he muttered. “You don’t know your place any better than a wild animal.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said nothing.

“You think you own me because you saved my life!”

And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>relaxed, glad not to have to take the life <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had saved—glad not to have to risk other lives, including my own.

“If <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ever caught myself wanting you like <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>want her, I’d cut my throat,” he said.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hoped that problem would never arise. If it did, one of us would do some cutting all right.

“Help me, Dana.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t.”

“You can! You and nobody else. Go to her. Send her to me. I’ll have her whether you help or not. All <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>want you to do is fix it so <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t have to beat her. You’re no friend of hers if you won’t do that much!”

Of hers! He had all the low cunning of his class. No, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t refuse to help the girl—help her avoid at least some pain. But she wouldn’t think much of me for helping her this way. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t think much of myself.

“Do it!” hissed Rufus.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up and went out to find her.

She was strange now, erratic, sometimes needing my friendship, trusting me with her dangerous longings for freedom, her wild plans to run away again; and sometimes hating me, blaming me for her trouble.

One night in the attic, she was crying softly and telling me something about Isaac. She stopped suddenly and asked, “Have you heard from your husband yet, Dana?”

“Not yet.”

“Write another letter. Even if you have to do it in secret.”

“I’m working on it.”

“No sense in you losing your man too.”

Yet moments later for no reason that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could see, she attacked me, “You ought to be ashamed of yourself, whining and crying after some poor white trash of a man, black as you are. You always try to act so white. White nigger, turning against your own people!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never really got used to her sudden switches, her attacks, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>put up with them. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had taken her through all the other stages of healing, and somehow, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t abandon her now. Most of the time, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t even get angry. She was like Rufus. When she hurt, she struck out to hurt others. But she had been hurting less as the days passed, and striking out less. She was healing emotionally as well as physically. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had helped her to heal. Now <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to help Rufus tear her wounds open again.

She was at Carrie’s cabin watching Jude and two other older babies someone had left with her. She had no regular duties yet, but like me, she had found her own work. She liked children, and she liked sewing. She would take the coarse blue cloth Weylin bought for the slaves and make neat sturdy clothing of it while small children played around her feet. Weylin complained that she was like old Mary with the children and the sewing, but he brought her his clothing to be mended. She worked better and faster than the slave woman who had taken over much of old Mary’s sewing—and if she had an enemy on the plantation, it was that woman, Liza, who was now in danger of being sent to more onerous work.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went into the cabin and sat down with Alice before the cold fireplace. Jude slept beside her in the crib Nigel had made for him. The other two babies were awake lying naked on blankets on the floor quietly playing with their feet.

Alice looked up at me, then held up a long blue dress. “This is for you,” she said. “I’m sick of seeing you in them pants.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked down at my jeans. “I’m so used to dressing like this, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>forget sometimes. At least it keeps me from having to serve at the table.”

“Serving ain’t bad.” She’d done it a few times. “And if Mister Tom wasn’t so stingy, you’d have had a dress a long time ago. Man loves a dollar more than he loves Jesus.”

That, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>believed literally. Weylin had dealings with banks. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew because he complained about them. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never known him to have any dealings with churches or hold any kind of prayer meeting in his home. The slaves had to sneak away in the night and take their chances with the patrollers if they wanted to have any kind of religious meeting.

“Least you can look like a woman when your man comes for you,” Alice said.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>drew a deep breath. “Thanks.”

“Yeah. Now tell me what you come here to say … that you don’t want to say.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at her, startled.

“You think <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know you after all this time? You got a look that says you don’t want to be here.”

“Yes. Rufus sent me to talk to you.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hesitated. “He wants you tonight.”

Her expression hardened. “He sent you to tell me that?”

“No.”

She waited, glaring at me, silently demanding that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tell her more.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said nothing.

“Well! What did he send you for then?”

“To talk you into going to him quietly, and to tell you you’d be whipped this time if you resist.”

“Shit! Well, all right, you told me. Now get out of here before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>throw this dress in the fireplace and light it.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t give a damn what you do with that dress.”

Now it was her turn to be startled. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t usually talk to her that way, even when she deserved it.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>leaned back comfortably in Nigel’s homemade chair. “Message delivered,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “Do what you want.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>mean to.”

“You might look ahead a little though. Ahead and in all three directions.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Well, it looks as though you have three choices. You can go to him as he orders; you can refuse, be whipped, and then have him take you by force; or you can run away again.”

She said nothing, bent to her sewing and drew the needle in quick neat tiny stitches even though her hands were shaking. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>bent down to play with one of the babies—one who had forgotten his own feet and crawled over to investigate my shoe. He was a fat curious little boy of several months who began trying to pull the buttons off my blouse as soon as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>picked him up.

“He go’ pee all over you in a minute,” said Alice. “He likes to let go just when somebody’s holding him.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>put the baby down quickly—just in time, as it turned out.

“Dana?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at her.

“What am <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>going to do?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hesitated, shook my head. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t advise you. It’s your body.”

“Not mine.” Her voice had dropped to a whisper. “Not mine, his. He paid for it, didn’t he?”

“Paid who? You?”

“You know he didn’t pay me! Oh, what’s the difference? Whether it’s right or wrong, the law says he owns me now. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know why he hasn’t already whipped the skin off me. The things I’ve said to him …”

“You know why.”

She began to cry. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ought to take a knife in there with me and cut his damn throat.” She glared at me. “Now go tell him that! Tell him I’m talking ’bout killing him!”

“Tell him yourself.”

“Do your job! Go tell him! That’s what you for—to help white folks keep niggers down. That’s why he sent you to me. They be calling you mammy in a few years. You be running the whole house when the old man dies.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shrugged and stopped the curious baby from sucking on my shoe string.

“Go tell on me, Dana. Show him you the kind of woman he needs, not me.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said nothing.

“One white man, two white men, what difference do it make?”

“One black man, two black men, what difference does that make?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could have ten black men without turning against my own.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shrugged again, refusing to argue with her. What could <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>win?

She made a wordless sound and covered her face with her hands. “What’s the matter with you?” she said wearily. “Why you let me run you down like that? You done everything you could for me, maybe even saved my life. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>seen people get lockjaw and die from way less than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had wrong with me. Why you let me talk about you so bad?”

“Why do you do it?”

She sighed, bent her body into a “c” as she crouched in the chair. “Because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>get so mad … <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>get so mad <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can taste it in my mouth. And you’re the only one <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can take it out on—the only one <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can hurt and not be hurt back.”

“Don’t keep doing it,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>have feelings just like you do.”

“Do you want me to go to him?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t tell you that. You have to decide.”

“Would you go to him?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>glanced at the floor. “We’re in different situations. What I’d do doesn’t matter.”

“Would you go to him?”

“No.”

“Even though he’s just like your husband?”

“He isn’t.”

“But … All right, even though you don’t … don’t hate him like <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do?”

“Even so.”

“Then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>won’t go either.”

“What will you do?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know. Run away?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up to leave.

“Where you going?” she asked quickly.

“To stall Rufus. If <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>really work at it, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can get him to let you off tonight. That will give you a start.”

She dropped the dress to the floor and came out of her chair to grab me. “No, Dana! Don’t go.” She drew a deep breath, then seemed to sag. “I’m lying. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t run again. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t. You be hungry and cold and sick out there, and so tired you can’t walk. Then they find you and set dogs on you … My Lord, the dogs …” She was silent for a moment. “I’m going to him. He knew <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would sooner or later. But he don’t know how <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wish <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had the nerve to just kill him!”





12


She went to him. She adjusted, became a quieter more subdued person. She didn’t kill, but she seemed to die a little.

Kevin didn’t come to me, didn’t write. Rufus finally let me write another letter—payment for services rendered, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>supposed—and he mailed it for me. Yet another month went by, and Kevin didn’t reply.

“Don’t worry about it,” Rufus told me. “He probably did move again. We’ll be getting a letter from him in Maine any day now.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t say anything. Rufus had become talkative and happy, openly affectionate to a quietly tolerant Alice. He drank more than he should have sometimes, and one morning after he’d really overdone it, Alice came downstairs with her whole face swollen and bruised.

That was the morning <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped wondering whether <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>should ask him to help me go North to find Kevin. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t have expected him to give me money, but he could have gotten me some damned official-looking free papers. He could even have gone with me, at least to the Pennsylvania State Line. Or he could have stopped me cold.

He had already found the way to control me—by threatening others. That was safer than threatening me directly, and it worked. It was a lesson he had no doubt learned from his father. Weylin, for instance, had known just how far to push Sarah. He had sold only three of her children—left her one to live for and protect. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t doubt now that he could have found a buyer for Carrie, afflicted as she was. But Carrie was a useful young woman. Not only did she work hard and well herself, not only had she produced a healthy new slave, but she had kept first her mother, and now her husband in line with no effort at all on Weylin’s part. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want to find out how much Rufus had learned from his father’s handling of her.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>longed for my map now. It contained names of towns <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could write myself passes to. No doubt some of the towns on it didn’t exist yet, but at least it would have given me a better idea of what was ahead. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have to take my chances without it.

Well, at least <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew that Easton was a few miles to the north, and that the road that ran past the Weylin house would take me to it. Unfortunately, it would also take me through a lot of open fields—places where it would be nearly impossible to hide. And pass or no pass, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would hide from whites if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have to carry food—johnnycake, smoked meat, dried fruit, a bottle of water. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had access to what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>needed. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had heard of runaway slaves starving before they reached freedom, or poisoning themselves because they were as ignorant as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was about which wild plants were edible.

In fact, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had read and heard enough scare stories about the fate of runaways to keep me with the Weylins for several days longer than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>meant to stay. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might not have believed them, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had the example of Isaac and Alice before me. Fittingly, then, it was Alice who gave me the push <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>needed.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was helping Tess with the wash—sweating and stirring dirty clothes as they boiled in their big iron pot—when Alice came to me, crept to me, looking back over her shoulder, her eyes wide with what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>read as fear.

“You look at this,” she said to me, not even glancing at Tess who had stopped pounding a pair of Weylin’s pants to watch us. She trusted Tess. “See,” she said. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>been looking where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t s’pose to look—in Mister Rufe’s bed chest. But what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found don’t look like it ought to be there.”

She took two letters from her apron pocket. Two letters, their seals broken, their faces covered with my handwriting.

“Oh my God,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>whispered.

“Yours?”

“Yes.”

“Thought so. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can read some words. Got to take these back now.”

“Yes.”

She turned to go.

“Alice.”

“Yeah?”

“Thanks. Be careful when you put them back.”

“You be careful too,” she said. Our eyes met and we both knew what she was talking about.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>left that night.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>collected the food and “borrowed” one of Nigel’s old hats, to pull down over my hair—which wasn’t very long, luckily. When <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked Nigel for the hat, he just looked at me for a long moment, then got it for me. No questions. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t think he expected to see it again.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stole a pair of Rufus’s old trousers and a worn shirt. My jeans and shirts were too well known to Rufus’s neighbors, and the dress Alice had made me looked too much like the dresses every other slave woman on the place wore. Besides, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had decided to become a boy. In the loose, shabby, but definitely male clothing <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had chosen, my height and my contralto voice would get me by. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hoped.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>packed everything <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could into my denim bag and left it in its place on my pallet where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>normally used it as a pillow. My freedom of movement was more useful to me now than it had ever been. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could go where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted to and no one said, “What are you doing here? Why aren’t you working?” Everyone assumed <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was working. Wasn’t <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>the industrious stupid one who always worked?

So <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was left alone, allowed to make my preparations. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>even got a chance to prowl through Weylin’s library. Finally, at day’s end, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went to the attic with the other house servants and lay down to wait until they were asleep. That was my mistake.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted the others to be able to say they saw me go to bed. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted Rufus and Tom Weylin to waste time looking around the plantation for me tomorrow when they realized they hadn’t seen me for a while. They wouldn’t do that if some house servant—one of the children, perhaps—said, “She never went to bed last night.”

Overplanning.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up when the others had been quiet for some time. It was about midnight, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could be past Easton before morning. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had talked to others who had walked the distance. Before the sun rose, though, I’d have to find a place to hide and sleep. Then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could write myself a pass to one of the other places whose names and general locations <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had learned in Weylin’s library. There was a place near the county line called Wye Mills. Beyond that, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would veer northeast, slanting toward the plantation of a cousin of Weylin’s and toward Delaware to travel up the highest part of the peninsula. In that way, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hoped to avoid many of the rivers. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had a feeling they were what would make my trip long and difficult.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>crept away from the Weylin house, moving through the darkness with even less confidence than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had felt when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>fled to Alice’s house months before. Years before. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t known quite as well then what there was to fear. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never seen a captured runaway like Alice. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never felt the whip across my own back. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never felt a man’s fists.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt almost sick to my stomach with fear, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>kept walking. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stumbled over a stick that lay in the road and first cursed it, then picked it up. It felt good in my hand, solid. A stick like this had saved me once. Now, it quenched a little of my fear, gave me confidence. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>walked faster, moving into the woods alongside the road as soon as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>passed Weylin’s fields.

The way was north toward Alice’s old cabin, toward the Holman plantation, toward Easton which <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have to skirt. The walking was easy, at least. This was flat country with only a few barely noticeable rolling hills to break the monotony. The road ran through thick dark woods that were probably full of good places to hide. And the only water <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw flowed in streams so tiny they barely wet my feet. That wouldn’t last, though. There would be rivers.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hid from an old black man who drove a wagon pulled by a mule. He went by humming tunelessly, apparently fearing neither patrollers nor any other dangers of the night. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>envied his calmness.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hid from three white men who rode by on horseback. They had a dog with them, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was afraid it would smell me and give me away. Luckily, the wind was in my favor, and it went on its way. Another dog found me later, though. It came racing toward me through a field and over a rail fence, barking and growling. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned to meet it almost without thinking, and clubbed it down as it lunged at me.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t really afraid. Dogs with white men frightened me, or dogs in packs—Sarah had told me of runaways who had been torn to pieces by the packs of dogs used to hunt them. But one lone dog didn’t seem to be much of a threat.

As it turned out, the dog was no threat at all. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hit it, it fell, then got up and limped away yelping. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>let it go, glad <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t had to hurt it worse. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>liked dogs normally.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hurried on, wanting to be out of sight if the dog’s noise brought people out to investigate. The experience did make me a little more confident of my ability to defend myself, though, and the natural night noises disturbed me less.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>reached the town and avoided what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could see of it—a few shadowy buildings. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>walked on, beginning to tire, beginning to worry that dawn was not far away. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t tell whether my worrying was legitimate or came from my desire to rest. Not for the first time, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wished <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been wearing a watch when Rufus called me.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>pushed myself on until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could see that the sky really was growing light. Then, as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked around wondering where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could find shelter for the day, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard horses. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>moved farther from the road and crouched in a thick growth of bushes, grasses, and young trees. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was used to hiding now, and no more afraid than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been when I’d hidden before. No one had spotted me yet.

There were two horsemen moving slowly up the road toward me. Very slowly. They were looking around, peering through the dimness into the trees. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could see that one of them was riding a light colored horse. A gray horse, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw as it drew closer, a …

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>jumped. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>managed not to gasp, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did make that one small involuntary movement. And a twig that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t noticed snapped under me.

The horsemen stopped almost in front of me, Rufus on the gray he usually rode, and Tom Weylin on a darker animal. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could see them clearly now. They were looking for me—already! They shouldn’t even have known yet that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was gone. They couldn’t have known—unless someone told them. Someone must have seen me leaving, someone other than Rufus or Tom Weylin. They would simply have stopped me. It must have been one of the slaves. Someone had betrayed me. And now, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had betrayed myself.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard something,” said Tom Weylin.

And Rufus, “So did I. She’s around here somewhere.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shrank down, tried to make myself smaller without moving enough to make more noise.

“Damn that Franklin,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard Rufus say.

“You’re damning the wrong man,” said Weylin.

Rufus let that go unanswered.

“Look over there!” Weylin was pointing away from me, pointing into the woods ahead of me. He headed his horse over to investigate what he had seen—and frightened out a large bird.

Rufus’s eyes were better. He ignored his father and headed straight for me. He couldn’t have seen me, couldn’t have seen anything other than a possible hiding place. He plunged his horse into the bushes that hid me, plunged it in to either trample me or drive me out.

He drove me out. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>threw myself to one side away from the horse’s hooves.

Rufus let out a whoop and swung down literally on top of me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>fell under his weight, and the fall twisted my club out of my hand, set it in just the right position for me to fall on.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard my stolen shirt tear, felt the splintered wood scrape my side …

“She’s here!” called Rufus. “I’ve got her!”

He would get something else too if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could reach my knife. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>twisted downward toward the ankle sheath with him still on top of me. My side was suddenly aflame with pain.

“Come help me hold her,” he called.

His father strode over and kicked me in the face.

That held me, all right. From far away, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could hear Rufus shout— strangely soft shouting—“You didn’t have to do that!”

Weylin’s reply was lost to me as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>drifted into unconsciousness.





13


<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>awoke tied hand and foot, my side throbbing rhythmically, my jaw not throbbing at all. The pain there was a steady scream. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>probed with my tongue and found that two teeth on the right side were gone.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been thrown over Rufus’s horse like a grain sack, head and feet hanging, blood dripping from my mouth onto the familiar boot that let me know it was Rufus <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>rode with.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>made a noise, a kind of choked moan, and the horse stopped. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt Rufus move, then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was lifted down, placed in the tall grass beside the road. Rufus looked down at me.

“You damn fool,” he said softly. He took his handkerchief and wiped blood from my face. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>winced away, tears suddenly filling my eyes at the startlingly increased pain.

“Fool!” repeated Rufus.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>closed my eyes and felt the tears run back into my hair.

“You give me your word you won’t fight me, and I’ll untie you.”

After a while, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>nodded. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt his hands at my wrists, at my ankles.

“What’s this?”

He had found my knife, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought. Now he would tie me again. That’s what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have done in his place. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at him.

He was untying the empty sheath from my ankle. Just a piece of rough-cut, poorly sewn leather. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had apparently lost the knife in my struggle with him. No doubt, though, the shape of the sheath told him what it had held. He looked at it, then at me. Finally, he nodded grimly and, with a sharp motion, threw the sheath away.

“Get up.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried. In the end, he had to help me. My feet were numb from being tied, and were just coming back to painful life. If Rufus decided to make me run behind his horse, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would be dragged to death.

He noticed that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was holding my side as he half-carried me back to his horse, and he stopped to move my hand and look at the wound.

“Scratch,” he pronounced. “You were lucky. Going to hit me with a stick, were you? And what else were you going to do?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said nothing, thought of him sending his horse charging over the spot <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had barely leaped from in time.

As <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>leaned against his horse, he wiped more blood from my face, one hand firmly holding the top of my head so that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t wince away. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>bore it somehow.

“Now you’ve got a gap in your teeth,” he observed. “Well, if you don’t laugh big, nobody’ll notice. They weren’t the teeth right in front.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>spat blood and he never realized that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had made my comment on such good luck.

“All right,” he said, “let’s go.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>waited for him to tie me behind the horse or throw me over it grain-sack fashion again. Instead, he put me in front of him in the saddle. Not until then did <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>see Weylin waiting for us a few paces down the road.

“See there,” the old man said. “Educated nigger don’t mean smart nigger, do it?” He turned away as though he didn’t expect an answer. He didn’t get one.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat stiffly erect, holding my body straight somehow until Rufus said, “Will you lean back on me before you fall off! You got more pride than sense.”

He was wrong. At that moment, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t manage any pride at all. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>leaned back against him, desperate for any support <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could find, and closed my eyes.

He didn’t say anything more for a long while—not until we were nearing the house. Then,

“You awake, Dana?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat straight. “Yes.”

“You’re going to get the cowhide,” he said. “You know that.”

Somehow, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t known. His gentleness had lulled me. Now the thought of being hurt even more terrified me. The whip, again. “No!”

Without thinking about it or intending to do it, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>threw one leg over and slid from the horse. My side hurt, my mouth hurt, my face was still bleeding, but none of that was as bad as the whip. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ran toward the distant trees.

Rufus caught me easily and held me, cursing me, hurting me. “You take your whipping!” he hissed. “The more you fight, the more he’ll hurt you.”

He? Was Weylin to whip me, then, or the overseer, Edwards?

“Act like you’ve got some sense!” demanded Rufus as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>struggled.

What <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>acted like was a wild woman. If I’d had my knife, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would surely have killed someone. As it was, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>managed to leave scratches and bruises on Rufus, his father, and Edwards who was called over to help. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was totally beyond reasoning. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never in my life wanted so desperately to kill another human being.

They took me to the barn and tied my hands and raised whatever they had tied them to high over my head. When <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was barely able to touch the floor with my toes, Weylin ripped my clothes off and began to beat me.

He beat me until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>swung back and forth by my wrists, half-crazy with pain, unable to find my footing, unable to stand the pressure of hanging, unable to get away from the steady slashing blows …

He beat me until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried to make myself believe he was going to kill me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said it aloud, screamed it, and the blows seemed to emphasize my words. He would kill me. Surely, he would kill me if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t get away, save myself, go home!

It didn’t work. This was only punishment, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew it. Nigel had borne it. Alice had borne worse. Both were alive and healthy. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t going to die—though as the beating went on, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted to. Anything to stop the pain! But there was nothing. Weylin had ample time to finish whipping me.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was not aware of Rufus untying me, carrying me out of the barn and into Carrie’s and Nigel’s cabin. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was not aware of him directing Alice and Carrie to wash me and care for me as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had cared for Alice. That, Alice told me about later—how he demanded that everything used on me be clean, how he insisted on the deep ugly wound in my side—the scratch—being carefully cleaned and bandaged.

He was gone when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>awoke, but he left me Alice. She was there to calm me and feed me pills that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw were my own inadequate aspirins, and to assure me that my punishment was over, that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was all right. My face was almost too swollen for me to ask for salt water to wash my mouth. After several tries, though, she understood and brought it to me.

“Just rest,” she said. “Carrie and me’ll take care of you as good as you took care of me.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t try to answer. Her words touched something in me, though, started me crying silently. We were both failures, she and I. We’d both run and been brought back, she in days, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>in only hours. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>probably knew more than she did about the general layout of the Eastern Shore. She knew only the area she’d been born and raised in, and she couldn’t read a map. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew about towns and rivers miles away—and it hadn’t done me a damned bit of good! What had Weylin said? That educated didn’t mean smart. He had a point. Nothing in my education or knowledge of the future had helped me to escape. Yet in a few years an illiterate runaway named Harriet Tubman would make nineteen trips into this country and lead three hundred fugitives to freedom. What had <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>done wrong? Why was <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>still slave to a man who had repaid me for saving his life by nearly killing me. Why had <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>taken yet another beating. And why … why was <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>so frightened now—frightened sick at the thought that sooner or later, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have to run again?

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>moaned and tried not to think about it. The pain of my body was enough for me to contend with. But now there was a question in my mind that had to be answered.

Would <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>really try again? Could I?

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>moved, twisted myself somehow, from my stomach onto my side. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried to get away from my thoughts, but they still came.

See how easily slaves are made? they said.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>cried out as though from the pain of my side, and Alice came to ease me into a less agonizing position. She wiped my face with a cool damp cloth.

“I’ll try again,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said to her. And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered why <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was saying it, boasting, maybe lying.

“What?” she asked.

My swollen face and mouth were still distorting my speech. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have to repeat the words. Maybe they would give me courage if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said them often enough.

“I’ll try again.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>spoke as slowly and as clearly as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could.

“You rest!” Her voice was suddenly rough, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew she had understood. “Time enough later for talking. Go to sleep.”

But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t sleep. The pain kept me awake; my own thoughts kept me awake. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>caught myself wondering whether <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would be sold to some passing trader this time … or next time … <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>longed for my sleeping pills to give me oblivion, but some small part of me was glad <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t have them. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t quite trust myself with them just now. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t quite sure how many of them <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might take.

Liza, the sewing woman, fell and hurt herself. Alice told me all about it. Liza was bruised and battered. She lost some teeth. She was black and blue all over. Even Tom Weylin was concerned.

“Who did it to you?” he demanded. “Tell me, and they’ll be punished!”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>fell,” she said sullenly. “Fell on the stairs.”

Weylin cursed her for a fool and told her to get out of his sight.

And Alice, Tess, and Carrie concealed their few scratches and gave Liza quiet meaningful glances. Glances that Liza turned away from in anger and fear.

“She heard you get up in the night,” Alice told me. “She got up after you and went straight to Mister Tom. She knew better than to go to Mister Rufe. He might have let you go. Mister Tom never let a nigger go in his life.”

“But why?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked from my pallet. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was stronger now, but Rufus had forbidden me to get up. For once, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was glad to obey. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew that when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up, Tom Weylin would expect me to work as though <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>were completely well. Thus, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had missed Liza’s “accident” completely.

“She did it to get at me,” said Alice. “She would have liked it better if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been the one slipping out at night, but she hates you too—almost as much. She figures <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have died if not for you.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was startled. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never had a serious enemy—someone who would go out of her way to get me hurt or killed. To slaveholders and patrollers, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was just one more nigger, worth so many dollars. What they did to me didn’t have much to do with me personally. But here was a woman who hated me and who, out of sheer malice, had nearly killed me.

“She’ll keep her mouth shut next time,” said Alice. “We let her know what would happen to her if she didn’t. Now she’s more scared of us than of Mister Tom.”

“Don’t get yourselves into trouble over me,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said.

“Don’t be telling us what to do,” she replied.





15


The first day <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was up, Rufus called me to his room and handed me a letter—from Kevin to Tom Weylin.

“Dear Tom,” it said, “There may be no need for this letter since <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hope to reach you ahead of it. If I’m held up, however, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>want you—and Dana—to know that I’m coming. Please tell her I’m coming.”

It was Kevin’s handwriting—slanted, neat, clear. In spite of the years of note taking and longhand drafts, his writing had never gone to hell the way mine had. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked blankly at Rufus.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said once that Daddy was a fair man,” he said. “You all but laughed out loud.”

“He wrote to Kevin about me?”

“He did after … after …”

“After he learned that you hadn’t sent my letters?”

His eyes widened with surprise, then slowly took on a look of understanding. “So that’s why you ran. How did you find out?”

“By being curious.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>glanced at the bed chest. “By satisfying my curiosity.”

“You could be whipped for snooping through my things.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shrugged, and small pains shot through my scabby shoulders.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never even saw that they had been moved. I’ll have to watch you better from now on.”

“Why? Are you planning to hide more lies from me?”

He jumped, started to get up, then sat back down heavily and rested one polished boot on his bed. “Watch what you say, Dana. There are things <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>won’t take, even from you.”

“You lied,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>repeated deliberately. “You lied to me over and over. Why, Rufe?”

It took several seconds for his anger to dissolve and be replaced by something else. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>watched him at first, then looked away, uncomfortably. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted to keep you here,” he whispered. “Kevin hates this place. He would have taken you up North.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at him again and let myself understand. It was that destructive single-minded love of his. He loved me. Not the way he loved Alice, thank God. He didn’t seem to want to sleep with me. But he wanted me around—someone to talk to, someone who would listen to him and care what he said, care about him.

And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did. However little sense it made, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>cared. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>must have. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>kept forgiving him for things …

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stared out the window guiltily, feeling that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>should have been more like Alice. She forgave him nothing, forgot nothing, hated him as deeply as she had loved Isaac. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t blame her. But what good did her hating do? She couldn’t bring herself to run away again or to kill him and face her own death. She couldn’t do anything at all except make herself more miserable. She said, “My stomach just turns every time he puts his hands on me!” But she endured. Eventually, she would bear him at least one child. And as much as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>cared for him, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would not have done that. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t have. Twice, he had made me lose control enough to try to kill him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could get that angry with him, even though <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew the consequences of killing him. He could drive me to a kind of unthinking fury. Somehow, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t take from him the kind of abuse <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took from others. If he ever raped me, it wasn’t likely that either of us would survive.

Maybe that was why we didn’t hate each other. We could hurt each other too badly, kill each other too quickly in hatred. He was like a younger brother to me. Alice was like a sister. It was so hard to watch him hurting her—to know that he had to go on hurting her if my family was to exist at all. And, at the moment, it was hard for me to talk calmly about what he had done to me.

“North,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said finally. “Yes, at least there <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could keep the skin on my back.”

He sighed. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never wanted Daddy to whip you. But hell, don’t you know you got off easy! He didn’t hurt you nearly as much as he’s hurt others.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said nothing.

“He couldn’t let a runaway go without some punishment. If he did, there’d be ten more taking off tomorrow. He was easy on you, though, because he figured your running away was my fault.”

“It was.”

“It was your own fault! If you had waited …”

“For what! You were the one <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>trusted. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did wait until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found out what a liar you were!”

He took the charge without anger this time. “Oh hell, Dana … all right! <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>should have sent the letters. Even Daddy said <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>should have sent them after <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>promised you <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would. Then he said <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was a damn fool for promising.” He paused. “But that promise was the only thing that made him send for Kevin. He didn’t do it out of gratitude to you for helping me. He did it because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had given my word. If not for that, he would have kept you here until you went home. If you’re going to go home this time.”

We sat together in silence for a moment.

“Daddy’s the only man <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know,” he said softly, “who cares as much about giving his word to a black as to a white.”

“Does that bother you?”

“No! It’s one of the few things about him <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can respect.”

“It’s one of the few things about him you should copy.”

“Yeah.” He took his foot off the bed. “Carrie’s bringing a tray up here so we can eat together.”

That surprised me, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just nodded.

“Your back doesn’t hurt much, does it?”

“Yes.”

He stared out the window miserably until Carrie arrived with the tray.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went back to helping Sarah and Carrie the next day. Rufus said <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t have to, but as tedious as the work was, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could stand it easier than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could stand more long hours of boredom. And now that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew Kevin was coming, my back and side didn’t seem to hurt as much.

Then Jake Edwards came in to destroy my new-found peace. It was amazing how much misery the man could cause doing the same job Luke had managed to do without hurting anyone.

“You!” he said to me. He knew my name. “You go do the wash. Tess is going to the fields today.”

Poor Tess. Weylin had tired of her as a bed mate and passed her casually to Edwards. She had been afraid Edwards would send her to the fields where he could keep an eye on her. With Alice and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>in the house, she knew she could be spared. She had cried with the fear that she would be spared. “You do everything they tell you,” she wept, “and they still treat you like a old dog. Go here, open your legs; go there, bust your back. What they care! <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ain’t s’pose to have no feelin’s!” She had sat with me crying while <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>lay on my stomach sweating and hurting and knowing <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t as bad off as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would be a lot worse off now, though, if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>obeyed Edwards. He had no right to give me orders, and he knew it. His authority was over the field hands. But today, Rufus and Tom Weylin had gone into town leaving Edwards in charge, leaving him several hours to show us how “important” he was. I’d heard him outside the cookhouse trying to bully Nigel. And I’d heard Nigel’s answer, first placating—“I’m just doing what Marse Tom told me to do.” Finally threatening—“Marse Jake, you put your hands on me, you go’ get hurt. Now that’s all!”

Edwards backed off. Nigel was big and strong and not one to make idle threats. Also, Rufus tended to back Nigel, and Weylin tended to back Rufus. Edwards had cursed Nigel, then come into the cookhouse to bother me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had neither the size nor the strength to frighten him, especially now. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew what a day of washing would do to my back and side. I’d had enough pain, surely.

“Mr. Edwards, I’m not supposed to be washing. Mister Rufus told me not to.” It was a lie, but Rufus would back me too. In some ways, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could still trust him.

“You lyin’ nigger, you do what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tell you to do!” Edwards loomed over me. “You think you been whipped? You don’t know what a whippin’ is yet!” He carried his whip around with him. It was like part of his arm—long and black with its lead-weighted butt. He dropped the coil of it free.

And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went out, God help me, and tried to do the wash. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t face another beating so soon. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just couldn’t.

When Edwards was gone, Alice came out of Carrie’s cabin and began to help me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt sweat on my face mingling with silent tears of frustration and anger. My back had already begun to ache dully, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt dully ashamed. Slavery was a long slow process of dulling.

“You stop beatin’ them clothes ’fore you fall over,” Alice told me. “I’ll do this. You go back to the cookhouse.”

“He might come back,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “You might get in trouble.” It wasn’t her trouble <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was worried about; it was mine. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want to be dragged out of the cookhouse and whipped again.

“Not me,” she said. “He knows where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sleep at night.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>nodded. She was right. As long as she was under Rufus’s protection, Edwards might curse her, but he wouldn’t touch her. Just as he hadn’t touched Tess—until Weylin was finished with her …

“Thanks, Alice, but …”

“Who’s that?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked around. There was a white man, gray-bearded and dusty, riding around the side of the main house toward us. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought at first that it was the Methodist minister. He was a friend and sometime dinner guest of Tom Weylin in spite of Weylin’s indifference to religion. But no children gathered around this man as he rode. The kids always mobbed the minister—and his wife too when he brought her along. The couple dispensed candy and “safe” Bible verses (“Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters …”). The kids got candy for repeating the verses.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw two little girls staring at the gray-bearded stranger, but no one approached him or spoke to him. He rode straight back to us, stopped, sat looking at both of us uncertainly.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>opened my mouth to tell him the Weylins weren’t home, but in that moment, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got a good look at him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>dropped one of Rufus’s good white shirts into the dirt and stumbled over to the fence.

“Dana?” he said softly. The question mark in his voice scared me. Didn’t he know me? Had <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>changed so much? He hadn’t, beard or no beard.

“Kevin, get down. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t reach you up there.”

And he was off the horse and over the laundry yard fence, pulling me to him before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could take another breath.

The dull ache in my back and shoulders roared to life. Suddenly, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was struggling to get away from him. He let me go, confused.

“What the …?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went to him again because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t keep away, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>caught his arms before he could get them around me. “Don’t. My back is sore.”

“Sore from what?”

“From running away to find you. Oh, Kevin …”

He held me—gently now—for several seconds, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought if we could just go home then, at that moment, everything would be all right.

Finally, Kevin stood back from me a little, looked at me without letting me go. “Who beat you?” he asked quietly.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told you, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ran away.”

“Who?” he insisted. “Was it Weylin again?”

“Kevin, forget it.”

“Forget …?”

“Yes! Please forget it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might have to live here again someday.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shook my head. “Hate Weylin all you want to. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do. But don’t do anything to him. Let’s just get out of here.”

“It was him then.”

“Yes!”

He turned slowly and stared toward the main house. His face was lined and grim where it wasn’t hidden by the beard. He looked more than ten years older than when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had last seen him. There was a jagged scar across his forehead—the remnant of what must have been a bad wound. This place, this time, hadn’t been any kinder to him than it had been to me. But what had it made of him? What might he be willing to do now that he would not have done before?

“Kevin, please, let’s just go.”

He turned that same hard stare on me.

“Do anything to them and I’ll suffer for it,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>whispered urgently. “Let’s go! Now!”

He stared at me a moment longer, then sighed, rubbed his hand across his forehead. He looked at Alice, and because he didn’t speak to her, just kept looking, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned to look at her too.

She was watching us—watching dry-eyed, but with more pain than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had ever seen on another person’s face. My husband had come to me, finally. Hers would not be coming to her. Then the look was gone and her mask of toughness was in place again.

“You better do like she says,” she told Kevin softly. “Get her out of here while you can. No telling what our ‘good masters’ will do if you don’t.”

“You’re Alice, aren’t you?” asked Kevin.

She nodded as she would not have to Weylin or Rufus. They would have gotten a dull dry “yes, sir.” “Used to see you ’round here sometimes,” she said. “Back when things made sense.”

He made a sound, not quite a laugh. “Was there ever such a time?” He glanced at me, then back at her again, comparing. “Good Lord,” he murmured to himself. Then to her, “You going to be all right here, finishing this work by yourself?”

“Go’ be fine,” she said. “Just get her out of here.”

He finally seemed convinced. “Get your things,” he told me.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>almost told him to forget about my things. Extra clothing, medicine, tooth brush, pens, paper, whatever. But here, some of those things were irreplaceable. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>climbed the fence, went to the house and up to the attic as quickly as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could and stuffed everything into my bag. Somehow, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got out again without being seen, without having to answer questions.

At the laundry yard fence, Kevin waited, feeding something to his mare. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at the mare, wondering how tired she was. How far could she carry two people before she had to rest? How far could Kevin go before he had to rest? <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at him as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>reached him and could read weariness now in the dusty lines of his face. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered how fast he had traveled to reach me. When had he slept last?

For a moment, we stood wasting time, staring at each other. We couldn’t help it—<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t anyway. New lines and all, he was so damned beautiful.

“It’s been five years for me,” he said.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>whispered.

Abruptly, he turned away. “Let’s go! Let’s put this place behind us for good.”

Please, God. But not very likely. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned to say good-bye to Alice, called her name once. She was beating a pair of Rufus’s pants, and she kept beating them with no break in her rhythm to indicate that she had heard me.

“Alice!” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>called louder.

She did not turn, did not stop her beating and beating of those pants, though <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was certain now that she heard me. Kevin laid a hand on my shoulder and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>glanced at him, then again at her. “Good-bye, Alice,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said, this time not expecting any answer. There was none.

Kevin mounted and helped me up behind him. As we headed away, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>leaned against Kevin’s sweaty back and waited for the regular thump of her beating to fade. But we could still hear it faintly when we met Rufus on the road.

Rufus was alone. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was glad of that, at least. But he stopped a few feet ahead of us, frowning, deliberately blocking our way.

“Oh hell,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>muttered.

“You were just going to leave,” Rufus said to Kevin. “No thanks, nothing at all, just take her and go.”

Kevin stared at him silently for several seconds—stared until Rufus began to look uncomfortable instead of indignant.

“That’s right,” Kevin said.

Rufus blinked. “Look,” he said in a milder tone, “look, why don’t you stay for dinner. My father will be back by then. He’d want you to stay.”

“You can tell your father—!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>dug my fingers into Kevin’s shoulder, cutting off the rush of words before they became insulting in content as well as in tone. “Tell him we were in a hurry,” Kevin finished.

Rufus did not move from blocking our path. He looked at me.

“Good-bye, Rufe,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said quietly.

And without warning, with no perceptible change in mood, Rufus turned slightly and trained his rifle on us. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew a little about firearms now. It wasn’t wise for any but the most trusted slaves to show an interest in them, but then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been trusted before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ran away. Rufus’s gun was a flintlock, a long slender Kentucky rifle. He had even let me fire it a couple of times … before. And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had looked down the barrel of one like it for his sake. This one, however, was aimed more at Kevin. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stared at it, then at the young man holding it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>kept thinking <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew him, and he kept proving to me that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t.

“Rufe, what are you doing!” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>demanded.

“Inviting Kevin to dinner,” he said. And to Kevin, “Get down. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think Daddy might want to talk to you.”

People kept warning me about him, dropping hints that he was meaner than he seemed to be. Sarah had warned me and most of the time, she loved him like one of the sons she had lost. And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had seen the marks he occasionally left on Alice. But he had never been that way with me—not even when he was angry enough to be. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never feared him as I’d feared his father. Even now, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t as frightened as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>probably should have been. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t frightened for myself. That was why <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>challenged him.

“Rufe, if you shoot anybody, it better be me.”

“Dana, shut up!” said Kevin.

“You think <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>won’t?” said Rufus.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think if you don’t, I’ll kill you.”

Kevin got down quickly and hauled me down. He didn’t understand the kind of relationship Rufus and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had—how dependent we were on each other. Rufus understood though.

“No need for any talk of killing,” he said gently—as though he was quieting an angry child. And then to Kevin in a more normal tone, “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just think Daddy might have something to say to you.”

“About what?” Kevin asked.

“Well … about her keep, maybe.”

“My keep!” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>exploded, pulling away from Kevin. “My keep! I’ve worked, worked hard every day I’ve been here until your father beat me so badly <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t work! You people owe me! And you, Goddamnit, owe me more than you could ever pay!”

He swung the rifle to where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted it. Straight at me. Now <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would either goad him into shooting me or shame him into letting us go — or possibly, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would go home. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might go home wounded, or even dead, but one way or another, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would be away from this time, this place. And if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went home, Kevin would go with me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>caught his hand and held it.

“What are you going to do, Rufe? Keep us here at gun point so you can rob Kevin?”

“Get back to the house,” he said. His voice had gone hard.

Kevin and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at each other, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>spoke softly.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>already know all <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ever want to find out about being a slave,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told him. “I’d rather be shot than go back in there.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>won’t let them keep you,” Kevin promised. “Come on.”

“No!” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>glared at him. “You stay or go as you please. I’m not going back in that house!”

Rufus cursed in disgust. “Kevin, put her over your shoulder and bring her in.”

Kevin didn’t move. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have been amazed if he had.

“Still trying to get other people to do your dirty work for you, aren’t you, Rufe?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said bitterly. “First your father, now Kevin. To think <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasted my time saving your worthless life!” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stepped toward the mare and caught her reins as though to remount. At that moment, Rufus’s composure broke.

“You’re not leaving!” he shouted. He sort of crouched around the gun, clearly on the verge of firing. “Damn you, you’re not leaving me!”

He was going to shoot. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had pushed him too far. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was Alice all over again, rejecting him. Terrified in spite of myself, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>dove past the mare’s head, not caring how <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>fell as long as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>put something between myself and the rifle.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hit the ground—not too hard—tried to scramble up, and found that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t. My balance was gone. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard shouting—Kevin’s voice, Rufus’s voice … Suddenly, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw the gun, blurred, but seemingly only inches from my head. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hit at it and missed. It wasn’t quite where it appeared to be. Everything was distorted, blurred.

“Kevin!” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>screamed. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t leave him behind again—not even if my scream made Rufus fire.

Something landed heavily on my back and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>screamed again, this time in pain. Everything went dark.





The Storm


1


Home.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t have been unconscious for more than a minute. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>came to on the living room floor to find Kevin bending over me. There was no one for me to mistake him for this time. It was him, and he was home. We were home. My back felt as though I’d taken another beating, but it didn’t matter. I’d gotten us home without either of us being shot.

“I’m sorry,” said Kevin.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>focused on him clearly. “Sorry about what?”

“Doesn’t your back hurt?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>lowered my head, rested it on my hand. “It hurts.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>fell on you. Between Rufus and the horse and you screaming, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know how it happened, but …”

“Thank God it did happen. Don’t be sorry, Kevin, you’re here. You’d be stranded again if you hadn’t fallen on me.”

He sighed, nodded. “Can you get up? <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think I’d hurt you more by lifting you than you’d hurt yourself by walking.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up slowly, cautiously, found that it didn’t hurt any more to stand than it did to lie down. My head was clear now, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could walk without trouble.

“Go to bed,” said Kevin. “Get some rest.”

“Come with me.”

Something of the expression he’d had when we met in the laundry yard came back to him and he took my hands.

“Come with me,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>repeated softly.

“Dana, you’re hurt. Your back …”

“Hey.”

He stopped, pulled me closer.

“Five years?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>whispered.

“That long. Yes.”

“They hurt you.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>fingered the scar on his forehead.

“That’s nothing. It healed years ago. But you …”

“Please come with me.”

He did. He was so careful, so fearful of hurting me. He did hurt me, of course. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had known he would, but it didn’t matter. We were safe. He was home. I’d brought him back. That was enough.

Eventually, we slept.

He wasn’t in the room when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>awoke. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>lay still listening until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard him opening and closing doors in the kitchen. And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard him cursing. He had a slight accent, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>realized. Nothing really noticeable, but he did sound a little like Rufus and Tom Weylin. Just a little.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shook my head and tried to put the comparison out of my mind. He sounded as though he were looking for something, and after five years didn’t know where to find it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up and went to help.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found him fiddling with the stove, turning the burners on, staring into the blue flame, turning them off, opening the oven, peering in. He had his back to me and didn’t see or hear me. Before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could say anything, he slammed the oven door and stalked away shaking his head. “Christ,” he muttered. “If I’m not home yet, maybe <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t have a home.”

He went into the dining room without noticing me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stayed where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was, thinking, remembering.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could recall walking along the narrow dirt road that ran past the Weylin house and seeing the house, shadowy in twilight, boxy and familiar, yellow light showing from some of the windows—Weylin was surprisingly extravagant with his candles and oil. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had heard that other people were not. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could recall feeling relief at seeing the house, feeling that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had come home. And having to stop and correct myself, remind myself that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was in an alien, dangerous place. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could recall being surprised that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would come to think of such a place as home.

That was more than two months ago when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went to get help for Rufus. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been home to 1976, to this house, and it hadn’t felt that homelike. It didn’t now. For one thing, Kevin and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had lived here together for only two days. The fact that I’d had eight extra days here alone didn’t really help. The time, the year, was right, but the house just wasn’t familiar enough. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt as though <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>were losing my place here in my own time. Rufus’s time was a sharper, stronger reality. The work was harder, the smells and tastes were stronger, the danger was greater, the pain was worse … Rufus’s time demanded things of me that had never been demanded before, and it could easily kill me if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did not meet its demands. That was a stark, powerful reality that the gentle conveniences and luxuries of this house, of now, could not touch.

And if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt that way after spending only short periods in the past, what must Kevin be feeling after five years. His white skin had saved him from much of the trouble <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had faced, but still, he couldn’t have had an easy time.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found him in the living room trying knobs on the television set. It was new to us, that television, like the house. The on/off switch was under the screen out of sight, and Kevin clearly didn’t remember.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went to it, reached under, and switched the set on. There was a public service announcement on advising women to see their doctors and take care of themselves while they were pregnant.

“Turn it off,” said Kevin.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>obeyed.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw a woman die in childbirth once,” he said.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>nodded. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never saw it, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>kept hearing about it happening. It was pretty common back then, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess. Poor medical care or none at all.”

“No, medical care had nothing to do with the case <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw. This woman’s master strung her up by her wrists and beat her until the baby came out of her—dropped onto the ground.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>swallowed, looked away, rubbing my wrists. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>see.” Would Weylin have done such a thing to one of his pregnant slave women, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered. Probably not. He had more business sense than that. Dead mother, dead baby—dead loss. I’d heard stories, though, about other slaveholders who didn’t care what they did. There was a woman on Weylin’s plantation whose former master had cut three fingers from her right hand when he caught her writing. She had a baby nearly every year, that woman. Nine so far, seven surviving. Weylin called her a good breeder, and he never whipped her. He was selling off her children, though, one by one.

Kevin stared at the blank TV screen, then turned away with a bitter laugh. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>feel like this is just another stopover,” he said. “A little less real than the others, maybe.”

“Stopover?”

“Like Philadelphia. Like New York and Boston. Like that farm in Maine …”

“You did get to Maine, then?”

“Yes. Almost bought a farm there. Would have been a stupid mistake. Then a friend in Boston forwarded me Weylin’s letter. Home at last, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought, and you …” He looked at me. “Well. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got half of what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted. You’re still you.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went to him with relief that surprised me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t realized how much I’d worried, even now, that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might not be “still me” as far as he was concerned.

“Everything is so soft here,” he said, “so easy …”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know.”

“It’s good. Hell, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t go back to some of the pestholes I’ve lived in for pay. But still …”

We were walking through the dining room, through the hall. We stopped at my office and he went in to look at the map of the United States that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had on the wall. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>kept going farther and farther up the east coast,” he said. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have wound up in Canada next. But in all my traveling, do you know the only time <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ever felt relieved and eager to be going to a place?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think so,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said quietly.

“It was when …” He stopped, realizing what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had said, and frowned at me.

“It was when you went back to Maryland,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “When you visited the Weylins to see whether <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was there.”

He looked surprised, but strangely pleased. “How could you know that?”

“It’s true, isn’t it?”

“It’s true.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt it the last time Rufus called me. I’ve got no love at all for that place, but so help me, when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw it again, it was so much like coming home that it scared me.”

Kevin stroked his beard. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>grew this to come back.”

“Why?”

“To disguise myself. You ever hear of a man named Denmark Vesey?”

“The freedman who plotted rebellion down in South Carolina.”

“Yes. Well, Vesey never got beyond the planning stage, but he scared the hell out of a lot of white people. And a lot of black people suffered for it. Around that time, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was accused of helping slaves to escape. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>barely got out ahead of the mob.”

“Were you at the Weylins’ then?”

“No, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had a job teaching school.” He rubbed the scar on his forehead. “I’ll tell you all about it, Dana, but some other time. Now, somehow, I’ve got to fit myself back into nineteen seventy-six. If <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can.”

“You can.”

He shrugged.

“One more thing. Just one.”

He looked at me questioningly.

“Were you helping slaves to escape?”

“Of course <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was! <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>fed them, hid them during the day, and when night came, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>pointed them toward a free black family who would feed and hide them the next day.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>smiled and said nothing. He sounded angry, almost defensive about what he had done.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess I’m not used to saying things like that to people who understand them,” he said.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know. It’s enough that you did what you did.”

He rubbed his head again. “Five years is longer than it sounds. So much longer.”

We went on to his office. Both our offices were ex-bedrooms in the solidly built old frame house we had bought. They were big comfortable rooms that reminded me a little of the rooms in the Weylin house.

No. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shook my head, denying the impression. This house was nothing like the Weylin house. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>watched Kevin look around his office. He circled the room, stopping at his desk, at the file cabinets, at the book cases. He stood for a moment looking at the shelf filled with copies of The Water of Meribah, his most successful novel—the novel that had bought us this house. He touched a copy as though to take it down, then left it and drifted back to his typewriter. He fumbled with that for a moment, remembered how to turn it on, then looked at the stack of blank paper beside it and turned it off again. Abruptly, he brought his fist down hard on it.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>jumped at the sudden sound. “You’ll break it, Kevin.”

“What difference would that make?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>winced, remembered my own attempts to write when I’d been home last. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had tried and tried and only managed to fill my wastebasket.

“What am <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>going to do?” said Kevin, turning his back on the typewriter. “Christ, if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t feel anything even in here …”

“You will. Give yourself time.”

He picked up his electric pencil sharpener, examined it as though he did not know what it was, then seemed to remember. He put it down, took a pencil from a china cup on the desk, and put it in the sharpener. The little machine obligingly ground the pencil to a fine point. Kevin stared at the point for a moment, then at the sharpener.

“A toy,” he said. “Nothing but a damned toy.”

“That’s what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said when you bought it,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried to smile and make it a joke, but there was something in his voice that scared me.

With a sudden slash of his hand, he knocked both the sharpener and the cup of pencils from his desk. The pencils scattered and the cup broke. The sharpener bounced hard on the bare floor, just missing the rug. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>unplugged it quickly.

“Kevin …” He stalked out of the room before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could finish. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ran after him, caught his arm. “Kevin!”

He stopped, glared at me as though <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was some stranger who had dared to lay hands on him.

“Kevin, you can’t come back all at once any more than you can leave all at once. It takes time. After a while, though, things will fall into place.”

His expression did not change.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took his face between my hands and looked into his eyes, now truly cold. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know what it was like for you,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said, “being gone so long, having so little control over whether you’d ever get back. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t really know, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do know … that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>almost didn’t want to be alive when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought I’d left you behind for good. But now that you’re back …”

He pulled away from me and walked out of the room. The expression on his face was like something I’d seen, something <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was used to seeing on Tom Weylin. Something closed and ugly.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t go after him when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>left his office. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t know what to do to help him, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want to look at him and see things that reminded me of Weylin. But because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went to the bedroom, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found him.

He was standing beside the dresser looking at a picture of himself—himself as he had been. He had always hated having his picture taken, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had talked him into this one, a close-up of the young face under a cap of thick gray hair, dark brows, pale eyes …

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was afraid he would throw the picture down, smash it as he had tried to smash the pencil sharpener. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took it from his hand. He let it go easily and turned to look at himself in the dresser mirror. He ran a hand through his hair, still thick and gray. He would probably never be bald. But he looked old now; the young face had changed more than could be accounted for by the new lines in his face or the beard.

“Kevin?”

He closed his eyes. “Leave me alone for a while, Dana,” he said softly. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just need to be by myself and get used to … to things again.”

There was suddenly a loud, house-shaking sonic boom and Kevin jumped back against the dresser looking around wildly.

“Just a jet passing overhead,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told him.

He gave me what almost seemed to be a look of hatred, then brushed past me, went to his office and shut the door.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>left him alone. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t know what else to do—or even whether there was anything <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could do. Maybe this was something he had to work out for himself. Maybe it was something that only time could help. Maybe anything. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt so damned helpless as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked down the hall at his closed door. Finally, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went to bathe, and that hurt enough to hold my attention for a while. Then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>checked my denim bag, put in a bottle of antiseptic, Kevin’s large bottle of Excedrin, and an old pocket knife to replace the switchblade. The knife was large and easily as deadly as the switchblade <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had lost, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t be able to use it as quickly, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have a harder time surprising an opponent with it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>considered taking a kitchen knife of some kind instead, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought one big enough to be effective would be too hard to hide. Not that any kind of knife had been very effective for me so far. Having one just made me feel safer.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>dropped the knife into the bag and replaced soap, tooth paste, some clothing, a few other things. My thoughts went back to Kevin. Did he blame me for the five years he had lost, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered. Or if he didn’t now, would he when he tried to write again? He would try. Writing was his profession. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered whether he had been able to write during the five years, or rather, whether he had been able to publish. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was sure he had been writing. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t imagine either of us going for five years without writing. Maybe he’d kept a journal or something. He had changed — in five years he couldn’t help changing. But the markets he wrote for hadn’t changed. He might have a frustrating time for a while. And he might blame me.

It had been so good seeing him again, loving him, knowing his exile was ended. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had thought everything would be all right. Now <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered if anything would be all right.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>put on a loose dress and went to the kitchen to see what we could make a meal of—if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could get Kevin to eat. The chops <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had put out to defrost over two months ago were still icy. How long had we been away, then? What day was it? Somehow, neither of us had bothered to find out.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned on the radio and found a news station—tuned in right in the middle of a story about the war in Lebanon. The war there was worse. The President was ordering an evacuation of nonofficial Americans. That sounded like what he had been ordering on the day Rufus called me. A moment later, the announcer mentioned the day, confirming what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had thought. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been away for only a few hours. Kevin had been away for eight days. Nineteen seventy-six had not gone on without us.

The news switched to a story about South Africa—blacks rioting there and dying wholesale in battles with police over the policies of the white supremacist government.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned off the radio and tried to cook the meal in peace. South African whites had always struck me as people who would have been happier living in the nineteenth century, or the eighteenth. In fact, they were living in the past as far as their race relations went. They lived in ease and comfort supported by huge numbers of blacks whom they kept in poverty and held in contempt. Tom Weylin would have felt right at home.

After a while, the smell of food brought Kevin out of his office, but he ate in silence.

“Can’t <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>help?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked finally.

“Help with what?”

There was an edge to his voice that made me wary. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t answer.

“I’m all right,” he said grudgingly.

“No you’re not.”

He put his fork down. “How long were you away this time?”

“A few hours. Or just over two months. Take your pick.”

“There was a newspaper in my office. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was reading it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know how old it is, but …”

“It’s today’s paper. It came the morning Rufus called me last. That’s this morning if you want to believe the calendar. June eighteenth.”

“It doesn’t matter. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasted my time reading that paper. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t know what the hell it was talking about most of the time.”

“It’s like <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. The confusion doesn’t go away all at once. It doesn’t for me either.”

“It was so good coming home at first.”

“It was good. It still is.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know anything.”

“You’re in too much of a hurry. You …” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped, realized <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was swaying a little on my chair. “Oh God, no!” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>whispered.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>suppose <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>am,” said Kevin. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wonder how people just out of prison manage to readjust.”

“Kevin, go get my bag. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>left it in the bedroom.”

“What? Why …?”

“Go, Kevin!”

He went, understanding finally. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat still, praying that he would come back in time. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could feel tears streaming down my face. So soon, so soon … Why couldn’t <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>have had just a few days with him—a few days of peace at home?

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt something pressed into my hands and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>grasped it. My bag. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>opened my eyes to the dark blur of it, and the larger blur of Kevin standing near me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was suddenly afraid of what he might do.

“Get away, Kevin!”

He said something, but suddenly, there was too much noise for me to hear him—even if he had still been there.

There was water, rain pouring down on me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was sitting in mud clutching my bag.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up sheltering my bag as much as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could so that eventually, I’d have something dry to change into. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked around grimly for Rufus.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t find him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>peered through the dim gray light, looked around until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>realized where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could see the familiar boxy Weylin house in the distance, yellow light at one window. At least there would be no long walk for me this time. In this storm, that was something to be grateful for. But where was Rufus? If he was in trouble inside the house, why had <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>arrived outside?

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shrugged and started toward the house. If he was there, it would be stupid for me to waste time out here. Not that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could get any wetter.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tripped over him.

He was lying face down in a puddle so deep the water almost covered his head. Face down.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>grabbed him and pulled him out of the water and over to a tree that would shelter us a little from the rain. A moment later, there was thunder and a flash of lightning, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>dragged him away from the tree again. With his ability to draw bad luck <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want to take chances.

He was alive. As <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>moved him, he threw up on himself and partly on me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>almost joined him. He began to cough and mutter and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>realized that he was either drunk or sick. More probably drunk. He was also heavy. He didn’t look any bigger than he had when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw him last, but he was soaking wet now, and he was beginning to struggle feebly.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been dragging him toward the house while he was still. Now, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>dropped him in disgust and went to the house alone. Some stronger, more tolerant person could drag or carry him the rest of the way.

Nigel answered the door, stood peering down at me. “Who the devil …?”

“It’s Dana, Nigel.”

“Dana?” He was suddenly alert. “What happened? Where’s Marse Rufe?”

“Out there. He was too heavy for me.”

“Where?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked back the way <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had come and could not see Rufus. If he had flipped himself over again …

“Damn!” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>muttered. “Come on.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>led him back to the gray lump—still face up—that was Rufus. “Watch it,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “He threw up on me.”

Nigel picked Rufus up like a sack of grain, threw him over his shoulder, and strode back to the house in such quick long strides that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to run to keep up. Rufus threw up again down Nigel’s back, but Nigel paid no attention. The rain washed them both fairly clean before we reached the house.

Inside, we met Weylin who was coming down the stairs. He stopped short as he saw us. “You!” he said, staring at me.

“Hello, Mr. Weylin,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said wearily. He looked bent and old—thinner than ever. He walked with a cane.

“Is Rufus all right? Is he …?”

“He’s alive,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found him unconscious, face down in a ditch. A little more and he would have drowned.”

“If you’re here, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>suppose he would have.” The old man looked at Nigel. “Take him up to his room and put him to bed. Dana, you …” He stopped, looked at my dripping, clinging—to him—immodestly short dress. It was the kind of loose smocklike garment that little children of both sexes wore before they were old enough to work. It clearly offended Weylin more than my pants ever had. “Haven’t you got something decent to put on?” he asked.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at my wet bag. “Decent, maybe, but probably not dry.”

“Go put on what you’ve got, then come back down to the library.”

He wanted to talk to me, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought. Just what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>needed at the end of a long jumbled day. Weylin didn’t talk to me normally except to give orders. When he did, it was always harrowing. There was so much that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>coudn’t say; he took offense so easily.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>followed Nigel up the stairs, then went on to the narrow, ladderlike attic stairs. My old corner was empty so <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went there to put my bag down and search through it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found a nearly dry shirt and a pair of Levi’s that were wet only at the ankles. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>dried myself, changed, combed my hair, and spread out some of my wettest clothing to dry. Then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went down to Weylin. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had learned not to worry about leaving my things in the attic. Other house servants examined them. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew that because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had caught them at it now and then. But nothing was ever missing.

Apprehensively, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went through the library door.

“You look as young as you ever did,” Weylin complained sourly when he saw me.

“Yes, sir.” I’d agree with anything he said if it would get me away from him sooner.

“What happened to you there? Your face.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>touched the scab. “That’s where you kicked me, Mr. Weylin.”

He had been sitting in a worn old arm chair, but now he surged out of it like a young man, his cane a blunt wooden sword before him. “What are you talking about! It’s been six years since I’ve seen you.”

“Yes, sir.”

“Well!”

“For me, it’s only been a few hours.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought Rufus and Kevin had probably told him enough to enable him to understand, whether he believed or not. And perhaps he did understand. He seemed to get angrier.

“Who in hell ever said you were an educated nigger? You can’t even tell a decent lie. Six years for me is six years for you!”

“Yes, sir,” Why did he bother to ask me questions? Why did <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>bother to answer them?

He sat down again and leaned forward, one hand resting on his cane. His voice was softer, though, when he spoke. “That Franklin get back home all right?”

“Yes, sir.” What would happen if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked him where he thought that home was? But no, he had done at least one decent thing for Kevin and me, no matter what he was. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>met his eyes for a moment. “Thank you.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t do it for you.”

My temper flared suddenly. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t give a damn why you did it! I’m just telling you, one human being to another, that I’m grateful. Why can’t you leave it at that!”

The old man’s face went pale. “You want a good whipping!” he said. “You must not have had one for a while.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said nothing. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>realized then, though, that if he ever hit me again, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would break his scrawny neck. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would not endure it again.

Weylin leaned back in his chair. “Rufus always said you didn’t know your place any better than a wild animal,” he muttered. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>always said you were just another crazy nigger.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stood watching him.

“Why’d you help my son again?” he asked.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>settled down a little, shrugged. “Nobody ought to die the way he would have—lying in a ditch, drowning in mud and whiskey and his own vomit.”

“Stop it!” Weylin shouted. “I’ll take the cowhide to you myself! I’ll …” He fell silent, gasped for breath. His face was still dead white. He’d make himself really sick if he didn’t regain some of his old control.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>dropped back into indifference. “Yes, sir.”

After a moment he had control of himself. In fact, he sounded perfectly calm again. “You and Rufus had some trouble when you saw him last.”

“Yes, sir.” Having Rufus try to shoot me had been troublesome.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hoped you would go on helping him. You know there’s always a home for you here if you do.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>smiled a little in spite of myself. “Bad nigger that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>am, eh?”

“Is that the way you think of yourself?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>laughed bitterly. “No. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t kid myself much. Your son is still alive, isn’t he?”

“You’re bad enough. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know any other white man who would put up with you.”

“If you can manage to put up with me a little more humanely, I’ll go on doing what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can for Mister Rufus.”

He frowned. “Now what are you talking about?”

“I’m saying the day I’m beaten just once more, your son is on his own.”

His eyes widened, perhaps in surprise. Then he began to tremble. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never before seen a man literally trembling with anger. “You’re threatening him!” he stammered. “By God, you are crazy!”

“Crazy or sane, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>mean what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>say.” My back and side ached as though to warn me, but for the moment, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t afraid. He loved his son no matter how he behaved toward him, and he knew <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could do as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>threatened. “At the rate Mister Rufus has accidents,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said, “he might live another six or seven years without me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t count on more than that.”

“You damned black bitch!” He shook his cane at me like an extended forefinger. “If you think you can get away with making threats … giving orders …” He ran out of breath and began gasping again. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>watched without sympathy, wondering whether he was already sick. “Get out!” he gasped. “Go to Rufus. Take care of him. If anything happens to him, I’ll flay you alive!”

My aunt used to say things like that to me when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was little and did something to annoy her—“Girl, I’m going to skin you alive!” And she’d get my uncle’s belt and use it on me. But it had never occurred to me that anyone could make such a threat and mean it literally as Weylin meant it now. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned and left him before he could see that my courage had vanished. He could get help from his neighbors, from the patrollers, probably even from whatever police officials the area had. He could do anything he wanted to to me, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had no enforceable rights. None at all.





3


Rufus was sick again. When <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>reached his room <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found him lying in bed shaking violently while Nigel tried to keep him wrapped in blankets.

“What’s wrong with him?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked.

“Nothing,” said Nigel. “Got the ague again, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess.”

“Ague?”

“Yeah, he’s had it before. He’ll be all right.”

He didn’t look all right to me. “Has anyone gone for the doctor?”

“Marse Tom don’t hardly get Doc West for ague. He says all the doc knows is bleeding and blistering and purging and puking and making folks sicker than they was to start.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>swallowed, remembered the pompous little man <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had disliked so. “Is the doctor really that bad, Nigel?”

“He gave me some stuff once, nearly killed me. From then on, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just let Sarah doctor me when I’m sick. ’Least she don’t dose niggers like they was horses or mules.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shook my head and went close to Rufus’s bed. He looked miserable, seemed to be in pain. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried to think what the ague might be; the word was familiar, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t remember what I’d heard or read about it.

Rufus looked up at me, red-eyed, and tried to smile, though the grimace he managed was far from pleasant. To my surprise, his attempt touched me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t expected to still care about him except for my own and my family’s sake. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want to care.

“Idiot,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>muttered down at him.

He managed to look hurt.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at Nigel, wondered whether the disease could be as unimportant as he thought. Would he think it was important if he had been the one on his back shaking?

Nigel was busy plucking his wet shirt away from his skin. No one had given him a chance to change his clothes, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>realized.

“Nigel, I’ll stay here if you want to go dry off,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said.

He looked up, smiled at me. “You go away for six years,” he said, “then come back and fit right in. It’s like you never left.”

“Every time <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>go <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>keep hoping I’ll never come back.”

He nodded. “But at least you get some time of freedom.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked away, feeling strangely guilty that, yes, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did get some time of freedom. Not enough, but probably more than Nigel would ever know. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t like feeling guilty about it. Then something bit me on my ear and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>forgot my guilt. As <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>slapped at my ear, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>remembered, finally, what the ague was.

Malaria.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered dully whether the mosquito that had just bitten me was carrying the disease. In my reading I’d come across a lot of information on malaria and none of it led me to believe the disease was as harmless as Nigel seemed to think. It might not kill, but it weakened and it recurred and it could lower one’s resistance to other diseases. Also, with Rufus lying exposed as he was to new mosquito attacks, the disease could be spread over the plantation and beyond.

“Nigel, is there anything we can hang up to keep the mosquitoes off him?”

“Mosquitoes! He wouldn’t feel it if twenty mosquitoes bit him now.”

“No, but the rest of us would be feeling it eventually.”

“What do you mean?”

“Does anyone else have it now?”

“Don’t think so. Some of the children are sick, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think they have something wrong with their faces—one side all swollen up.”

Mumps? Never mind. “Well, let’s see if we can keep this from spreading. Is there any kind of mosquito netting—or whatever people use here?”

“Sure, for white folks. But …”

“Would you get some? With the help of the canopy, we should be able to enclose him completely.”

“Dana, listen!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at him.

“What do mosquitoes have to do with the ague?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>blinked, stared at him in surprise. He didn’t know. Of course he didn’t. Doctors of the day didn’t know. Which probably meant that Nigel wouldn’t believe me when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told him. After all, how could a thing as tiny as a mosquito make anybody sick? “Nigel, you know where I’m from, don’t you?”

He gave me something that wasn’t quite a smile. “Not New York.”

“No.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know where Marse Rufe said you was from.”

“It shouldn’t be that hard for you to believe him. You’ve seen me go home at least once.”

“Twice.”

“Well?”

He shrugged. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t say. If <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t seen … the way you go home, I’d just figure you were one crazy nigger. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>haven’t ever seen anybody do what you did. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t want to believe you, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do.”

“Good.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took a deep breath. “Where I’m from, people have learned that mosquitoes carry ague. They bite someone who’s sick with it, then later they bite healthy people and give them the disease.”

“How?”

“They suck blood from the sick and … pass on some of that blood when they bite a healthy person. Like a mad dog that bites a man and drives the man mad.” No talk about micro-organisms. Nigel not only wouldn’t believe me, he might decide <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>really was crazy.

“Doc says it’s something in the air that spreads ague—something off bad water and garbage. A miasma, he called it.”

“He’s wrong. He’s wrong about the bleeding and purging and the rest, he was wrong when he dosed you, and he’s wrong now. It’s a wonder any of his patients survive.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard he was good and quick when it comes to cutting off legs or arms.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to look at Nigel to see whether he was making a grisly joke. He wasn’t. “Get the mosquito net,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said wearily. “Let’s do what we can to keep that butcher away from here.”

He nodded and went away. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered whether or not he believed me, but it didn’t really matter. It wouldn’t cost anyone anything to take this small precaution.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked down at Rufus to see that he had stopped trembling and closed his eyes. His breathing was regular and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought he was asleep.

“Why do you keep trying to kill yourself?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said softly.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t expected an answer so <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was surprised when he spoke quietly. “Most of the time, living just isn’t worth the trouble.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat down next to his bed. “It never occurred to me that you might really want to die.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t.” He opened his eyes, looked at me, then shut them again and covered them with his hands. “But if your eyes and your head and your leg hurt the way mine do, dying might start to look good.”

“Your eyes hurt?”

“When <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>look around.”

“Did they hurt before when you had ague?”

“No. This isn’t ague. Ague is bad enough. My leg feels like it’s coming off, and my head …!”

He scared me. His pain seemed to increase and he twisted his body as though to move away from it, then untwisted quickly and lay panting.

“Rufe, I’m going to get your father. If he sees how sick you are, he’ll send for the doctor.”

He seemed to be too involved with his own pain to answer. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want to leave him until Nigel came back, though <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had no idea what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could do for him. My problem was solved when Weylin came in with Nigel.

“What is all this about mosquitoes giving people ague?” he demanded.

“We may be able to forget about that,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “This doesn’t look like malaria. Ague. He’s in a lot of pain. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think someone should go for the doctor.”

“You’re doctor enough for him.”

“But …” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped, took a deep breath, made myself calm down. Rufus was groaning behind me. “Mr. Weylin, I’m no doctor. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t have any idea what’s wrong with him. Whatever professional help is available, you should get it for him.”

“Should <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>now?”

“His life may be at stake.”

Weylin’s mouth was set in a straight hard line. “If he dies, you die, and you won’t die easy.”

“You already said that. But no matter what you do to me, your son will still be dead. Is that what you want?”

“You do your job,” he said stubbornly, “and he’ll live. You’re something different. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know what—witch, devil, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t care. Whatever you are, you just about brought a girl back to life when you came here last, and she wasn’t even the one you came to help. You come out of nowhere and go back into nowhere. Years ago, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have sworn there couldn’t even be anybody like you. You’re not natural! But you can feel pain—and you can die. Remember that and do your job. Take care of your master.”

“But, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tell you …”

He walked out of the room and shut the door behind him.

We got the mosquito netting and used it, just in case. Nigel said Weylin didn’t really mind letting us have it. He just didn’t want to hear any more damned nonsense about mosquitoes. He didn’t like to be taken for a fool.

“He’s as close to being scared of you as he’s ever been of anything,” said Nigel. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think he’d rather try to kill you than admit it though.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t see any sign of fear in him.”

“You don’t know him the way <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do.” Nigel paused. “Could he kill you, Dana?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know. It’s possible.”

“We better get Marse Rufe well then. Sarah has a kind of tea she makes that kind of helps the ague. Maybe it will help whatever Marse Rufe has now.”

“Would you ask her to brew up a pot?”

He nodded and went out.

Sarah came upstairs with Nigel to bring Rufus the tea and to see me. She looked old now. Her hair was streaked with gray and her face lined. She walked with a limp.

“Dropped a kettle on my foot,” she said. “Couldn’t walk at all for a while.” She gave me the feeling that everyone was getting older, passing me by. She brought me roast beef and bread to eat.

Rufus had a fever now. He didn’t want the tea, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>coaxed and bullied until he swallowed it. Then we all waited, but all that happened was that Rufus’s other leg began to hurt. His eyes bothered him most because moving them hurt him, and he couldn’t help following my movements or Nigel’s around the room. Finally, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>put a cool damp cloth over them. That seemed to help. He still had a lot of pain in his joints—his arms, his legs, everywhere. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could ease that, so <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took his candle and went up to the attic for my bag. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was just in time to catch a little girl trying to get the top off my Excedrin bottle. It scared me. She could just as easily have chosen the sleeping pills. The attic wasn’t as safe a place as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had thought.

“No, honey, give those to me.”

“They yours?”

“Yes.”

“They candy?”

Good Lord. “No, they’re medicine. Nasty medicine.”

“Ugh!” she said, and handed them back to me. She went back to her pallet next to another child. They were new children. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered whether the two little boys who had preceded them had been sold or sent to the fields.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took the Excedrin, what was left of the aspirin, and the sleeping pills back down with me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have to keep them somewhere in Rufus’s room or eventually one of the kids would figure out how to get the safety caps off.

Rufus had thrown off the damp cloth and was knotted on his side in pain when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got back to him. Nigel had lain down on the floor before the fireplace and gone to sleep. He could have gone back to his cabin, but he had asked me if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted him to stay since this was my first night back, and I’d said yes.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>dissolved three aspirins in water and tried to get Rufus to drink it. He wouldn’t even open his mouth. So <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>woke Nigel, and Nigel held him down while <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>held his nose and poured the bad-tasting solution into his mouth as he gasped for air. He cursed us both, but after a while he began to feel a little better. Temporarily.

It was a bad night. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t get much sleep. Nor was <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>to get much for six days and nights following. Whatever Rufus had, it was terrible. He was in constant pain, he had fever—once <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to call Nigel to hold him while <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tied him down to keep him from hurting himself. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>gave him aspirins—too many, but not as many as he wanted. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>made him take broth and soup and fruit and vegetable juices. He didn’t want them. He never wanted to eat, but he didn’t want Nigel holding him down either. He ate.

Alice came in now and then to relieve me. Like Sarah, she looked older. She also looked harder. She was a cool, bitter older sister to the girl <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had known.

“Folks treat her bad because of Marse Rufe,” Nigel told me. “They figure if she’s been with him this long, she must like it.”

And Alice said contemptuously, “Who cares what a bunch of niggers think!”

“She lost two babies,” Nigel told me. “And the one she’s got left is sickly.”

“White babies,” Alice said. “Look more like him than me. Joe is even red-headed.” Joe was the single survivor. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>almost cried when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard that. No Hagar yet. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was so tired of this going back and forth; <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted so much for it to be over. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t even feel sorry for the friend who had fought for me and taken care of me when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was hurt. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was too busy feeling sorry for myself.

On the third day of his illness, Rufus’s fever left him. He was weak and several pounds lighter, but so relieved to be rid of the fever and the pain that nothing else mattered. He thought he was getting well. He wasn’t.

The fever and the pain returned for three more days and he got a rash that itched and eventually peeled …

At last, he got well and stayed well. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>prayed that whatever his disease had been, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t get it, wouldn’t ever have to care for anyone else who had it. A few days after the worst of his symptoms had disappeared, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was allowed to sleep in the attic. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>collapsed gratefully onto the pallet Sarah had made me there, and it felt like the world’s softest bed. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t awaken until late the next morning after long hours of deep, unbroken sleep. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was still a little groggy when Alice came running up the steps and into the attic to get me.

“Marse Tom is sick,” she said. “Marse Rufe wants you to come.”

“Oh no,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>muttered. “Tell him to send for the doctor.”

“Already sent for. But Marse Tom is having bad pains in his chest.”

The significance of that filtered through to me slowly. “Pains in his chest?”

“Yeah. Come on. They in the parlor.”

“God, that sounds like a heart attack. There’s nothing <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can do.”

“Just come. They want you.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>pulled on a pair of pants and threw on a shirt as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ran. What did these people want from me? Magic? If Weylin was having a heart attack, he was going to either recover or die without my help.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ran down the stairs and into the parlor where Weylin lay on a sofa, ominously still and silent.

“Do something!” Rufus pleaded. “Help him!” His voice sounded as thin and weak as he looked. His sickness had left its marks on him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered how he had gotten downstairs.

Weylin wasn’t breathing, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t find a pulse. For a moment, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stared at him, undecided, repelled, not wanting to touch him again, let alone breathe into him. Then quelling disgust, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>began mouth to mouth resuscitation and external heart massage—what did they call it? Cardiopulmonary resuscitation. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew the name, and I’d seen someone doing it on television. Beyond that, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was completely ignorant. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t even know why <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was trying to save Weylin. He wasn’t worth it. And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t know if CPR could do any good in an era when there was no ambulance to call, no one to take over for me even if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>somehow got Weylin’s heart going—which <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t expect to do.

Which <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t do.

Finally, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>gave up. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked around to see Rufus on the floor near me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t know whether he had sat down or fallen, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was glad he was sitting now.

“I’m sorry, Rufe. He’s dead.”

“You let him die?”

“He was dead when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got here. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried to bring him back the way <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>brought you back when you were drowning. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>failed.”

“You let him die.”

He sounded like a child about to cry. His illness had weakened him so, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought he might cry. Even healthy people cried and said irrational things when their parents died.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could, Rufe. I’m sorry.”

“Damn you to hell, you let him die!” He tried to lunge at me, succeeded only in falling over. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>moved to help him up, but stopped when he tried to push me away.

“Send Nigel to me,” he whispered. “Get Nigel.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up and went to find Nigel. Behind me, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard Rufus say once more, “You just let him die.”

Things were happening too fast for me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was almost glad to find myself put back to work with Sarah and Carrie, ignored by Rufus. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>needed time to catch up with myself—and catch up with life on the plantation. Carrie and Nigel had three sons now, and Nigel had never mentioned it to me because the youngest was two years old. He had forgotten that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t know. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was with him once, as he watched them playing. “It’s good to have children,” he said softly. “Good to have sons. But it’s so hard to see them be slaves.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>met Alice’s thin pale little boy and saw with relief that in spite of the way she talked, she obviously loved the child.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>keep thinking <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might wake up and find him cold like the others,” she said one day in the cookhouse.

“What did they die of?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked.

“Fevers. The doctor came and bled them and purged them, but they still died.”

“He bled and purged babies?”

“They were two and three. He said it would break the fever. And it did. But they … they died anyway.”

“Alice, if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>were you, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t ever let that man near Joe.”

She looked at her son sitting on the floor of the cookhouse eating mush and milk. He was five years old and he looked almost white in spite of Alice’s dark skin. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never wanted no doctor near the other two,” said Alice. “Marse Rufe sent for him—sent for him and made me let him kill my babies.”

Rufus’s intentions had been good. Even the doctor’s intentions had probably been good. But all Alice knew was that her children were dead and she blamed Rufus. Rufus himself was to teach me about that attitude.

On the day after Weylin was buried, Rufus decided to punish me for letting the old man die. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t know whether he honestly believed <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had done such a thing. Maybe he just needed to hurt someone. He did lash out at others when he was hurt; <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had already seen that.

So on the morning after the funeral, he sent the current overseer, a burly man named Evan Fowler, to get me from the cookhouse. Jake Edwards had either quit or been fired sometime during my six-year absence. Fowler came to tell me <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was to work in the fields.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t believe it, even when the man pushed me out of the cookhouse. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought he was just another Jake Edwards throwing his weight around. But outside, Rufus stood waiting, watching. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at him, then back at Fowler.

“This the one?” Fowler asked Rufus.

“That’s her,” said Rufus. And he turned and went back into the main house.

Stunned, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took the sicklelike corn knife Fowler thrust into my hands and let myself be herded out toward the cornfield. Herded. Fowler got his horse and rode a little behind me as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>walked. It was a long walk. The cornfield wasn’t where I’d left it. Apparently, even in this time, planters practiced some form of crop rotation. Not that that mattered to me. What in the world could <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do in a cornfield?

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>glanced back at Fowler. “I’ve never done field work before,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told him. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know how.”

“You’ll learn,” he said. He used the handle of his whip to scratch his shoulder.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>began to realize that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>should have resisted, should have refused to let Fowler bring me out here where only other slaves could see what happened to me. Now it was too late. It was going to be a grim day.

Slaves were walking down rows of corn, chopping the stalks down with golf-swing strokes of their knives. Two slaves worked a row, moving toward each other. Then they gathered the stalks they had cut and stood them in bunches at opposite ends of the row. It looked easy, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>suspected that a day of it could be backbreaking.

Fowler dismounted and pointed toward a row.

“You chop like the others,” he said. “Just do what they do. Now get to work.” He shoved me toward the row. There was already someone at the other end of it working toward me. Someone quick and strong, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hoped, because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>doubted that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would be quick or strong for a while. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hoped that the washing and the scrubbing at the house and the factory and warehouse work back in my own time had made me strong enough just to survive.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>raised the knife and chopped at the first stalk. It bent over, partially cut.

At almost the same moment, Fowler lashed me hard across the back.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>screamed, stumbled, and spun around to face him, still holding my knife. Unimpressed, he hit me across the breasts.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>fell to my knees and doubled over in a blaze of pain. Tears ran down my face. Even Tom Weylin hadn’t hit slave women that way—any more than he’d kicked slave men in the groin. Fowler was an animal. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>glared up at him in pain and hatred.

“Get up!” he said.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t think anything could make me get up just then—until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw Fowler raising his whip again.

Somehow, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up.

“Now do what the others do,” he said. “Chop close to the ground. Chop hard!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>gripped the knife, felt myself much more eager to chop him.

“All right,” he said. “Try it and get it over with. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought you was supposed to be smart.”

He was a big man. He hadn’t impressed me as being very quick, but he was strong. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was afraid that even if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>managed to hurt him, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t hurt him enough to keep him from killing me. Maybe <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>should make him try to kill me. Maybe it would get me out of this Godawful place where people punished you for helping them. Maybe it would get me home. But in how many pieces? Fowler would take the knife away from me and give it back edge first.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned and slashed furiously at the corn stalk, then at the next. Behind me, Fowler laughed.

“Maybe you got some sense after all,” he said.

He watched me for a while, urging me on, literally cracking the whip. By the time he left, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was sweating, shaking, humiliated. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>met the woman who had been working toward me and she whispered, “Slow down! Take a lick or two if you have to. You kill yourself today, he’ll push you to kill yourself every day.”

There was sense in that. Hell, if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went on the way <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t even last through today. My shoulders were already beginning to ache.

Fowler came back as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was gathering the cut stalks. “What the devil do you think you’re doing!” he demanded. “You ought to be halfway down the next row by now.” He hit me across the back as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>bent down. “Move! You’re not in the cookhouse getting fat and lazy now. Move!”

He did that all day. Coming up suddenly, shouting at me, ordering me to go faster no matter how fast <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went, cursing me, threatening me. He didn’t hit me that often, but he kept me on edge because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never knew when a blow would fall. It got so just the sound of his coming terrified me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>caught myself cringing, jumping at the sound of his voice.

The woman in my row explained, “He’s always hard on a new nigger. Make ’em go fast so he can see how fast they can work. Then later on if they slow down, he whip ’em for gettin’ lazy.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>made myself slow down. It wasn’t hard. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t think my shoulders could have hurt much worse if they’d been broken. Sweat ran down into my eyes and my hands were beginning to blister. My back hurt from the blows I’d taken as well as from sore muscles. After a while, it was more painful for me to push myself than it was for me to let Fowler hit me. After a while, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was so tired, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t care either way. Pain was pain. After a while, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just wanted to lie down between the rows and not get up again.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stumbled and fell, got up and fell again. Finally, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>lay face-down in the dirt, unable to get up. Then came a welcome blackness. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could have been going home or dying or passing out; it made no difference to me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was going away from the pain. That was all.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was on my back when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>came to and there was a white face floating just above me. For a wild moment, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought it was Kevin, thought <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was home. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said his name eagerly.

“It’s me, Dana.”

Rufus’s voice. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was still in hell. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>closed my eyes, not caring what would happen next.

“Dana, get up. You’ll be hurt more if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>carry you than if you walk.”

The words echoed strangely in my head. Kevin had said something like that to me once. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>opened my eyes again to be sure it was Rufus.

It was. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was still in the cornfield, still lying in the dirt.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>came to get you,” said Rufus. “Not soon enough, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>struggled to my feet. He offered a hand to help me, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ignored it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>brushed myself off a little and followed him down the row toward his horse. From there, we rode together back to the house without a word passing between us. At the house, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went straight to the well, got a bucket of water, carried it up the stairs somehow, then washed, spread antiseptic on my new cuts, and put on clean clothes. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had a headache that eventually drove me down to Rufus’s room for some Excedrin. Rufus had used all the aspirins.

Unfortunately, he was in his room.

“Well, you’re no good in the fields,” he said when he saw me. “That’s clear.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped, turned, and stared at him. Just stared. He had been sitting on his bed, leaning back against the headboard, but now he straightened, faced me.

“Don’t do anything stupid, Dana.”

“Right,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said softly. “I’ve done enough stupid things. How many times have <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saved your life so far?” My aching head sent me to his desk where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had left the Excedrin. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shook three of them into my hand. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never taken so many before. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never needed so many before. My hands were trembling.

“Fowler would have given you a good whipping if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t stopped him,” said Rufus. “That’s not the first beating I’ve saved you from.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had my Excedrin. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned to leave the room.

“Dana!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped, looked at him. He was thin and weak and hollow-eyed; his illness had left its marks on him. He probably couldn’t have carried me to his horse if he’d tried. And he couldn’t stop me from leaving now—<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought.

“You walk away from me, Dana, you’ll be back in the fields in an hour!”

The threat stunned me. He meant it. He’d send me back out. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stood staring at him, not with anger now, but with surprise—and fear. He could do it. Maybe later, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have a chance to make him pay, but for now, he could do as he pleased. He sounded more like his father than himself. In that moment, he even looked like his father.

“Don’t you ever walk away from me again!” he said. Strangely, he began to sound a little afraid. He repeated the words, spacing them, emphasizing each one. “Don’t you ever walk away from me again!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stood where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was, my head throbbing, my expression as neutral as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could make it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>still had some pride left.

“Get back in here!” he said.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stood there for a moment longer, then went back to his desk and sat down. And he wilted. The look <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>associated with his father vanished. He was himself again—whoever that was.

“Dana, don’t make me talk to you like that,” he said wearily. “Just do what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tell you.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shook my head, unable to think of anything safe to say. And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wilted. To my shame, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>realized <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was almost crying. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>needed desperately to be alone. Somehow, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>kept back the tears.

If he noticed, he didn’t say anything. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>remembered <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>still had the Excedrin tablets in my hand, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took them, swallowed them without water, hoping they’d work quickly, steady me a little. Then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at Rufus, saw that he’d lain back again. Was <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>supposed to stay and watch him sleep?

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t see how you can swallow those things like that,” he said, rubbing his throat. There was a long silence, then another command. “Say something! Talk to me!”

“Or what?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked. “Are you going to have me beaten for not talking to you?”

He muttered something <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t quite hear.

“What?”

Silence. Then a rush of bitterness from me.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saved your life, Rufus! Over and over again.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped for a moment, caught my breath. “And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried to save your father’s life. You know <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did. You know <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t kill him or let him die.”

He moved uncomfortably, wincing a little. “Give me some of your medicine,” he said.

Somehow, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t throw the bottle at him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up and handed it to him.

“Open it,” he said. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t want to be bothered with that damn top.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>opened it, shook one tablet into his hand, and snapped the top back on.

He looked at the tablet. “Only one?”

“These are stronger than the others,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. And also, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted to hang on to them for as long as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could. Who knew how many more times he would make me need them. The ones <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had taken were beginning to help me already.

“You took three,” he said petulantly.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>needed three. No one has been beating you.”

He looked away from me, put the one into his mouth. He still had to chew tablets before he could swallow them. “This tastes worse than the others,” he complained.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ignored him, put the bottle away in the desk.

“Dana?”

“What?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know you tried to help Daddy. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know.”

“Then why did you send me to the field? Why did <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>have to go through all that, Rufe?”

He shrugged, winced, rubbed his shoulders. He still had plenty of sore muscles, apparently. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just had to make somebody pay. And it seemed that … well, people don’t die when you’re taking care of them.”

“I’m not a miracle worker.”

“No. Daddy thought you were, though. He didn’t like you, but he thought you could heal better than a doctor.”

“Well <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t. Sometimes I’m less likely to kill than the doctor, that’s all.”

“Kill?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t bleed or purge away people’s strength when they need it most. And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know enough to try to keep a wound clean.”

“Is that all?”

“That’s enough to save a few lives around here, but no, it’s not all. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know a little about some diseases. Only a little.”

“What do you know about … about a woman who’s been hurt in childbearing?”

“Been hurt how?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered whether he meant Alice.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know. The doctor said she wasn’t to have any more and she did. The babies died and she almost died. She hasn’t been well since.”

Now <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew who he was talking about. “Your mother?”

“Yes. She’s coming home. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>want you to take care of her.”

“My God! Rufe, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know anything about problems like that! Believe me, nothing at all.” What if the woman died in my care. He’d have me beaten to death!

“She wants to come home, now that … She wants to come home.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t care for her. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know how.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hesitated. “Your mother doesn’t like me anyway, Rufe. You know that as well as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do.” She hated me. She’d make my life hell out of pure spite.

“There’s no one else I’d trust,” he said. “Carrie’s got her own family now. I’d have to take her out of her cabin away from Nigel and the boys …”

“Why?”

“Mama has to have someone with her through the night. What if she needed something?”

“You mean I’d have to sleep in her room?”

“Yes. She’d never have a servant sleep in her room before. Now, though, she’s gotten used to it.”

“She won’t get used to me. I’m telling you, she won’t have me.” Please heaven!

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think she will. She’s older now, not so full of fire. You give her her laudanum when she needs it and she won’t give you much trouble.”

“Laudanum?”

“Her medicine. She doesn’t need it so much for pain anymore, Aunt May says. But she still needs it.”

Since laudanum was an opium extract, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t doubt that she still needed it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was going to have a drug addict on my hands. A drug addict who hated me. “Rufe, couldn’t Alice …”

“No!” A very sharp no. It occurred to me that Margaret Weylin had more reason to hate Alice than she did to hate me.

“Alice will be having another baby in a few months anyway,” said Rufus.

“She will? Then maybe …” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shut my mouth, but the thought went on. Maybe this one would be Hagar. Maybe for once, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had something to gain by staying here. If only …

“Maybe what?”

“Nothing. It doesn’t matter. Rufe, I’m asking you not to put your mother in my care, for her sake and for mine.”

He rubbed his forehead. “I’ll think about it, Dana, and talk to her. Maybe she remembers someone she’d like. Let me sleep now. I’m still so damn weak.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>started out of the room.

“Dana.”

“Yes?” What now?

“Go read a book or something. Don’t do any more work today.”

“Read a book?”

“Do whatever you want to.”

In other words, he was sorry. He was always sorry. He would have been amazed, uncomprehending if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>refused to forgive him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>remembered suddenly the way he used to talk to his mother. If he couldn’t get what he wanted from her gently, he stopped being gentle. Why not? She always forgave him.

Margaret Weylin wanted me. She was thin and pale and weak and older than her years. Her beauty had gone to a kind of fragile gaunt- ness. As <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was reintroduced to her, she sipped at her little bottle of dark brownish-red liquid and smiled beneficently.

Nigel carried her up to her room. She could walk a little, but she couldn’t manage the stairs. Sometime later, she wanted to see Nigel’s children. She was sugary sweet with them. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t remember her being that way with anyone but Rufus before. Slave children hadn’t interested her unless her husband had fathered them. Then her interest had been negative. But she gave Nigel’s sons candy and they loved her.

She asked to see another slave—one <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t know—and then wept a little when she heard that one had been sold. She was full of sweetness and charity. It scared me a little. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t quite believe she’d changed that much.

“Dana, can you still read the way you used to?” she asked me.

“Yes, ma’am.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted you because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>remembered how well you read.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>kept my expression neutral. If she didn’t remember what she had thought of my reading, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did.

“Read the Bible to me,” she said.

“Now?” She had just had her breakfast. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t had anything yet, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was hungry.

“Now, yes. Read the Sermon on the Mount.”

That was the beginning of my first full day with her. When she was tired of hearing me read, she thought of other things for me to do. Her laundry, for instance. She wouldn’t trust anyone else to do it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered whether she had already found out that Alice generally did the laundry. And there was cleaning. She didn’t believe her room had been swept and dusted until she saw me do it. She didn’t believe Sarah understood how she wanted dinner prepared until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went down, got Sarah, and brought her back with me to receive instructions. She had to talk to Carrie and Nigel about the cleaning. She had to inspect the boy and girl who served at the table. In short, she had to prove that she was running her own house again. It had gone along without her for years, but she was back now.

She decided to teach me to sew. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had an old Singer at home and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could sew well enough with it to take care of my needs and Kevin’s. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought sewing by hand, especially sewing for “pleasure” was slow torture. Margaret Weylin never asked me whether <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted to learn though. She had time to fill, and it was my job to help her fill it. So <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>spent long tedious hours trying to imitate her tiny, straight, even stitches, and she spent minutes ripping out my work and lecturing me none too gently on how bad it was.

As the days passed, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>learned to take longer than necessary when she sent me on errands. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>learned to tell lies to get away from her when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was about to explode. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>learned to listen silently while she talked and talked and talked … mostly about how much better things were in Baltimore than here. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never learned to like sleeping on the floor of her room, but she wouldn’t permit the trundle bed to be brought in. She honestly didn’t see that it was any hardship for me to sleep on the floor. Niggers always slept on the floor.

Troublesome as she was, though, Margaret Weylin had mellowed. She didn’t have the old bursts of temper any more. Maybe it was the laudanum.

“You’re a good girl,” she said to me once as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat near her bed stitching at a slip cover. “Much better than you used to be. Someone must have taught you to behave.”

“Yes, ma’am.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t even look up.

“Good. You were impudent before. There’s nothing worse than an impudent nigger.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

She depressed me, bored me, angered me, drove me crazy. But my back healed completely while <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was with her. The work wasn’t hard and she never complained about anything but my sewing. She never threatened me or tried to have me whipped. Rufus said she was pleased with me. That seemed to surprise even him. So <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>endured her quietly. By now, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew enough to realize when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was well off. Or <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did.

“You ought to see yourself,” Alice told me one day as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was hiding out in her cabin—the cabin Rufus had had Nigel build her just before the birth of her first child.

“What do you mean?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked.

“Marse Rufe really put the fear of God in you, didn’t he?”

“Fear of … What are you talking about?”

“You run around fetching and carrying for that woman like you love her. And half a day in the fields was all it took.”

“Hell, Alice, leave me alone. I’ve been listening to nonsense all morning. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t need yours.”

“You don’t want to hear me, get out of here. The way you always suckin’ up to that woman is enough to make anybody sick.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up and went to the cookhouse. There were times when it was stupid to expect reason from Alice, times when it did no good to point out the obvious.

There were two field hands in the cookhouse. One young man who had a broken leg splinted and obviously healing crooked, and one old man who didn’t do much work any more. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could hear them before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went in.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know Marse Rufe’ll get rid of me if he can,” said the young man. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ain’t no good to him. His daddy would have got rid of me.”

“Won’t nobody buy me,” said the old man. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was burnt out long time ago. It’s you young ones got to worry.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went into the cookhouse and the young man who had his mouth open to speak closed it quickly, looking at me with open hostility. The old man simply turned his back. I’d seen slaves do that to Alice. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t noticed them doing it to me before. Suddenly, the cookhouse was no more comfortable than Alice’s cabin had been. It might have been different if Sarah or Carrie had been there, but they weren’t. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>left the cookhouse and went back toward the main house, feeling lonely.

Once <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was inside, though, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered why <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had crept away like that. Why hadn’t <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>fought back? Alice accusing me was ridiculous, and she knew it. But the field hands … They just didn’t know me, didn’t know how loyal <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might be to Rufus or Margaret, didn’t know what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might report.

And if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told them, how likely would they be to believe me?

But still …

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went down the hall and toward the stairs slowly, wondering why <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t tried to defend myself—at least tried. Was <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>getting so used to being submissive?

Upstairs, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could hear Margaret Weylin thumping on the floor with her cane. She didn’t use the cane much for walking because she hardly ever walked. She used it to call me.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned and went back out of the house, out toward the woods. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to think. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t getting enough time to myself. Once—God knows how long ago—<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had worried that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was keeping too much distance between myself and this alien time. Now, there was no distance at all. When had <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped acting? Why had <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped?

There were people coming toward me through the woods. Several people. They were on the road, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was several feet off it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>crouched in the trees to wait for them to pass. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was in no mood to answer some white man’s stupid inevitable questions: “What are you doing here? Who’s your master?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could have answered without trouble. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was nowhere near the edge of Weylin land. But just for a while, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted to be my own master. Before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>forgot what it felt like.

A white man went by on horseback leading two dozen black men chained two by two. Chained. They wore handcuffs and iron collars with chains connecting the collars to a central chain that ran between the two lines. Behind the men walked several women roped together neck to neck. A coffle—slaves for sale.

At the end of the procession rode a second white man with a gun in his belt. They were all headed for the Weylin house.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>realized suddenly that the slaves in the cookhouse had not been speculating idly about the possibility of being sold. They had known that there was a sale coming. Field hands who never set foot in the main house, and they had known. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t heard a thing.

Lately, Rufus spent his time either straightening out his father’s affairs, or sleeping. The weakness left over from his illness was still with him, and he had no time for me. He barely had time for his mother. But he had time to sell slaves. He had time to make himself that much more like his father.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>let the coffle reach the house far ahead of me. By the time <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got there, three slaves were already being added to the line. Two men, one grim-faced, one openly weeping; and one woman who moved as though she were sleepwalking. As <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got closer, the woman began to look familiar to me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped, almost not wanting to know who it was. A tall, strongly built, handsome woman.

Tess.

I’d seen her only two or three times this trip. She was still working in the fields, still serving the overseer at night. She’d had no children, and that may have been why she was being sold. Or maybe this was something Margaret Weylin had arranged. She might be that vindictive if she knew of her husband’s temporary interest in Tess.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>started toward Tess and the white man who had just tied a rope around her neck, fastening her into the line, saw me. He turned to face me, gun drawn.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped, alarmed, confused … <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had made no threatening move. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just wanted to say good-bye to my friend,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was whispering for some reason.

“Say it from there. She can hear you.”

“Tess?”

She stood, head down, shoulders rounded, a little red bundle hanging from one hand. She should have heard me, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t think she had.

“Tess, it’s Dana.”

She never looked up.

“Dana!” Rufus’s voice from near the steps where he was talking with the other white man. “You get away from here. Go inside.”

“Tess?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>called once more, willing her to answer. She knew my voice, surely. Why wouldn’t she look up? Why wouldn’t she speak? Why wouldn’t she even move? It was as though <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t exist for her, as though <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t real.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stepped toward her. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have gone to her, taken the rope from her neck or gotten shot trying. But at that moment, Rufus reached me. He grabbed me, hustled me into the house, into the library.

“Stay here!” he ordered. “Just stay …” He stopped, suddenly stumbled against me, clutching at me now, not to hold me where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was, but to keep himself upright. “Damn!”

“How could you do it!” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hissed as he straightened. “Tess … those others …”

“They’re my property!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stared at him in disbelief. “Oh my God …!”

He passed a hand over his face, turned away. “Look, this sale is something my father arranged before he died. You can’t do anything about it, so just stay out of the way!”

“Or what? You going to sell me too? You might as well!”

He went back outside without answering. After a while, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat down in Tom Weylin’s worn arm chair and put my head down on his desk.

Carrie covered for me with Margaret Weylin. She wanted me to know that when she caught me heading back upstairs. Actually, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know why <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was heading upstairs, except that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want to see Rufus again for a while, and there was nowhere else to go.

Carrie stopped me on the stairs, looked at me critically, then took my arm and led me back down and out to her cabin. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t know or care what she had in mind, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did understand when she told me through gestures that she had told Margaret Weylin <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was sick. Then she circled her neck with the thumbs and forefingers of both hands and looked at me.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “Tess and two others.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>drew a ragged breath. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought that was over on this plantation. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought it died with Tom Weylin.”

Carrie shrugged.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wish <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had left Rufus lying in the mud,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “To think <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saved him so he could do something like this …!”

Carrie caught my wrist and shook her head vigorously.

“What do you mean, no? He’s no good. He’s all grown up now, and part of the system. He could feel for us a little when his father was running things—when he wasn’t entirely free himself. But now, he’s in charge. And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess he had to do something right away, to prove it.”

Carrie clasped her hands around her neck again. Then she drew closer to me and clasped them around my neck. Finally, she went over to the crib that her youngest child had recently outgrown and there, symbolically, clasped her hands again, leaving enough of an open circle for a small neck.

She straightened and looked at me.

“Everybody?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked.

She nodded, gestured widely with her arms as though gathering a group around her. Then, once again, her hands around her neck.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>nodded. She was almost surely right. Margaret Weylin could not run the plantation. Both the land and the people would be sold. And if Tom Weylin was any example, the people would be sold without regard for family ties.

Carrie stood looking down at the crib as though she had read my thought.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was beginning to feel like a traitor,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “Guilty for saving him. Now … <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know what to feel. Somehow, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>always seem to forgive him for what he does to me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t hate him the way <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>should until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>see him doing things to other people.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shook my head. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can see why there are those here who think I’m more white than black.”

Carrie made quick waving-aside gestures, her expression annoyed. She came over to me and wiped one side of my face with her fingers—wiped hard. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>drew back, and she held her fingers in front of me, showed me both sides. But for once, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t understand.

Frustrated, she took me by the hand and led me out to where Nigel was chopping firewood. There, before him, she repeated the face-rubbing gesture, and he nodded.

“She means it doesn’t come off, Dana,” he said quietly. “The black. She means the devil with people who say you’re anything but what you are.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hugged her and got away from her quickly so that she wouldn’t see that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was close to tears. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went up to Margaret Weylin and she’d just had her laudanum. Being with her at such times was like being alone. And being alone was just what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>needed.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>avoided Rufus for three days after the sale. He made it easy for me. He avoided me too. Then on the fourth day he came looking for me. He found me in his mother’s room yes-ma’aming her and changing her bed while she sat looking thin and frail beside the window. She barely ate. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had actually caught myself coaxing her to eat. Then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>realized that she enjoyed being coaxed. She could forget to be superior sometimes, and just be someone’s old mother. Rufus’s mother. Unfortunately.

He came in and said, “Let Carrie finish that, Dana. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>have something else for you to do.”

“Oh, do you have to take her now?” said Margaret. “She was just …”

“I’ll send her back later, Mama. And Carrie’ll be up to finish your bed in a minute.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>left the room silently, not looking forward to whatever he had in mind.

“Down to the library,” he said right behind me.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>glanced back at him, trying to gauge his mood, but he only looked tired. He ate well and got twice the rest he should have needed, but he always looked tired.

“Wait a minute,” he said.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped.

“Did you bring another of those pens with the ink inside?”

“Yes.”

“Get it.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went up to the attic where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>still kept most of my things. I’d brought a packet of three pens this time, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>only took one back down with me—in case he still took as much pleasure as he had last trip in wasting ink.

“You ever hear of dengue fever?” he asked as he went down the stairs.

“No.”

“Well, according to the doc in town, that’s what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told him about it.” He had been going back and forth to town often since his father’s death. “Doc said he didn’t see how I’d made it without bleeding and a good emetic. Says I’m still weak because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t get all the poisons out of my body.”

“Put yourself in his hands,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said quietly. “And with a little luck, that will solve both our problems.”

He frowned uncertainly. “What do you mean by that?”

“Not a thing.”

He turned and caught me by the shoulders in a grip that he probably meant to be painful. It wasn’t. “Are you trying to say you want me to die?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sighed. “If <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did, you would, wouldn’t you?”

Silence. He let go of me and we went into the library. He sat down in his father’s old arm chair and motioned me into a hard Windsor chair nearby. Which was one step up from his father who had always made me stand before him like a school kid sent to the principal’s office.

“If you think that little sale was bad—and Daddy really had already arranged it—you better make sure nothing happens to me.” Rufus leaned back and looked at me wearily. “Do you know what would happen to the people here if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>died?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>nodded. “What bothers me,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said, “is what’s going to happen to them if you live.”

“You don’t think I’m going to do anything to them, do you?”

“Of course you are. And I’ll have to watch and remember and decide when you’ve gone too far. Believe me, I’m not looking forward to the job.”

“You take a lot on yourself.”

“None of it was my idea.”

He muttered something inaudible, and probably obscene. “You ought to be in the fields,” he added. “God knows why <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t leave you out there. You would have learned a few things.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have been killed. You would have had to start taking very good care of yourself.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shrugged. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t think you have the knack.”

“Damnit, Dana … What’s the good of sitting here trading threats? <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t believe you want to hurt me any more than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>want to hurt you.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said nothing.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>brought you down here to write a few letters for me, not fight with me.”

“Letters?”

He nodded. “I’ll tell you, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hate to write. Don’t mind reading so much, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hate to write.”

“You didn’t hate it six years ago.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t have to do it then. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t have eight or nine people all wanting answers, and wanting them now.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>twisted the pen in my hands. “You’ll never know how hard <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>worked in my own time to avoid doing jobs like this.”

He grinned suddenly. “Yes <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do. Kevin told me. He told me about the books you wrote too. Your own books.”

“That’s how he and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>earn our living.”

“Yeah. Well, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought you might miss it—writing your own things, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>mean. So <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got enough paper for you to write for both of us.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at him, not quite sure I’d heard right. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had read that paper in this time was expensive, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had seen that Weylin had never had very much of it. But here was Rufus offering … Offering what? A bribe? Another apology?

“What’s the matter?” he said. “Seems to me, this is better than any offer I’ve made you so far.”

“No doubt.”

He got paper, made room for me at the desk.

“Rufe, are you going to sell anyone else?”

He hesitated. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hope not. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t like it.”

“What’s to hope? Why can’t you just not do it?”

Another hesitation. “Daddy left debts, Dana. He was the most careful man <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know with money, but he still left debts.”

“But won’t your crops pay them?”

“Some of them.”

“Oh. What are you going to do?”

“Get somebody who makes her living by writing to write some very persuasive letters.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wrote his letters. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to read several of the letters he’d received first to pick up the stilted formal style of the day. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want Rufus having to face some creditor that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had angered with my twentieth-century brevity—which could come across as nineteenth-century abruptness, even discourtesy. Rufus gave me a general idea of what he wanted me to say and then approved or disapproved of the way <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said it. Usually, he approved. Then we started to go over his father’s books together. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never did get back to Margaret Weylin.

And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t ever to get back to her full time. Rufus brought a young girl named Beth in from the fields to help with the housework. That eventually freed Carrie to spend more time with Margaret. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>continued to sleep in Margaret’s room because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>agreed with Rufus that Carrie belonged with her family, at least at night. That meant <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to put up with Margaret waking me up when she couldn’t sleep and complaining bitterly that Rufus had taken me away just when she and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>were beginning to get on so well …

“What does he have you doing?” she asked me several times — suspiciously.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told her.

“Seems as though he could do that himself. Tom always did it himself.”

Rufus could have done it himself too, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought, though <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never said it aloud. He just didn’t like working alone. Actually, he didn’t like working at all. But if he had to do it, he wanted company. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t realize how much he preferred my company in particular until he came in one night a little drunk and found Alice and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>eating together in her cabin. He had been away eating with a family in town—“Some people with daughters they want to get rid of,” Alice had told me. She had said it with no concern at all even though she knew her life could become much harder if Rufus married. Rufus had property and slaves and was apparently quite eligible.

He came home, and not finding either of us in the house, came out to Alice’s cabin. He opened the door and saw us both looking up at him from the table, and he smiled happily.

“Behold the woman,” he said. And he looked from one to the other of us. “You really are only one woman. Did you know that?”

He tottered away.

Alice and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at each other. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought she would laugh because she took any opportunity she could find to laugh at him—though not to his face because he would beat her when he decided she needed it.

She didn’t laugh. She shuddered, then got up, not too gracefully—her pregnancy was showing now—and looked out the door after him.

After a while, she asked, “Does he ever take you to bed, Dana?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>jumped. Her bluntness could still startle me. “No. He doesn’t want me and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t want him.”

She glanced back at me over one shoulder. “What you think your wants got to do with it?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said nothing because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>liked her. And no answer <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could give could help sounding like criticism of her.

“You know,” she said, “you gentle him for me. He hardly hits me at all when you’re here. And he never hits you.”

“He arranges for other people to hit me.”

“But still … <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know what he means. He likes me in bed, and you out of bed, and you and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>look alike if you can believe what people say.”

“We look alike if we can believe our own eyes!”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess so. Anyway, all that means we’re two halves of the same woman—at least in his crazy head.”

The time passed slowly, uneventfully, as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>waited for the birth of the child <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hoped would be Hagar. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went on helping Rufus and his mother. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>kept a journal in shorthand. (“What the devil are these chicken marks?” Rufus asked me when he looked over my shoulder one day.) It was such a relief to be able to say what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt, even in writing, without worrying that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might get myself or someone else into trouble. One of my secretarial classes had finally come in handy.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried husking corn and blistered my slow clumsy hands while experienced field hands sped through the work effortlessly, enjoying themselves. There was no reason for me to join them, but they seemed to be making a party of the husking—Rufus gave them a little whiskey to help them along—and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>needed a party, needed anything that would relieve my boredom, take my mind off myself.

It was a party, all right. A wild rough kind of party that nobody modified because “the master’s women”—Alice and I—were there. People working near me around the small mountain of corn laughed at my blisters and told me <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was being initiated. A jug went around and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tasted it, choked, and drew more laughter. Surprisingly companionable laughter. A man with huge muscles told me it was too bad <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was already spoken for, and that earned me hostile looks from three women. After the work, there were great quantities of food—chicken, pork, vegetables, corn bread, fruit—better food than the herring and corn meal field hands usually saw so much of. Rufus came out to play hero for providing such a good meal, and the people gave him the praise he wanted. Then they made gross jokes about him behind his back. Strangely, they seemed to like him, hold him in contempt, and fear him all at the same time. This confused me because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt just about the same mixture of emotions for him myself. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had thought my feelings were complicated because he and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had such a strange relationship. But then, slavery of any kind fostered strange relationships. Only the overseer drew simple, unconflicting emotions of hatred and fear when he appeared briefly. But then, it was part of the overseer’s job to be hated and feared while the master kept his hands clean.

Young people began disappearing in pairs after a while, and some of the older ones stopped their eating or drinking or singing or talking long enough to give them looks of disapproval—or more understanding wistful looks. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought about Kevin and missed him and knew <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t going to sleep well that night.

At Christmas, there was another party—dancing, singing, three marriages.

“Daddy used to make them wait until corn shucking or Christmas to marry,” Rufus told me. “They like parties when they marry, and he made a few parties do.”

“Anything to pinch a few pennies,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said tactlessly.

He glanced at me. “You’d better be glad he didn’t waste money. You’re the one who gets upset when some quick money has to be raised.”

My mind had caught up with my mouth by then, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>kept quiet. He hadn’t sold anyone else. The harvest had been good and the creditors patient.

“Found anybody you want to jump the broom with?” he asked me.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at him startled and saw that he wasn’t serious. He was smiling and watching the slaves do a bowing, partner-changing dance to the music of a banjo.

“What would you do if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had found someone?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked.

“Sell him,” he said. His smile was still in place, but there was no longer any humor in it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>noticed, now, that he was watching the big muscular man who had tried to get me to dance—the same man who had spoken to me at the corn husking. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have to ask Sarah to tell him not to speak to me again. He didn’t mean anything, but that wouldn’t save him if Rufus got angry.

“One husband is enough for me,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said.

“Kevin?”

“Of course, Kevin.”

“He’s a long way off.”

There was something in his tone that shouldn’t have been there. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned to face him. “Don’t talk stupid.”

He jumped and looked around quickly to see whether anyone had heard.

“You watch your mouth,” he said.

“Watch yours.”

He stalked away angrily. We’d been working together too much lately, especially now that Alice was so advanced in her pregnancy. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was grateful when Alice herself created another job for me—a job that got me away from him regularly. Sometime during the week-long Christmas holiday, Alice persuaded him to let me teach their son Joe to read and write.

“It was my Christmas present,” she told me. “He asked me what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told him <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted my son not to be ignorant. You know, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to fight with him all week to get him to say yes!”

But he had said it, finally, and the boy came to me every day to learn to draw big clumsy letters on the slate Rufus bought him and read simple words and rhymes from the books Rufus himself had used. But unlike Rufus, Joe wasn’t bored with what he was learning. He fastened onto the lessons as though they were puzzles arranged for his entertainment—puzzles he loved solving. He could get so intense—throw screaming kicking tantrums when something seemed to be eluding him. But not all that much eluded him.

“You’ve got a damn bright little kid there,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told Rufus. “You ought to be proud.”

Rufus looked surprised—as though it had never occurred to him that there might be anything special about the undersized runny-nosed child. He had spent his life watching his father ignore, even sell the children he had had with black women. Apparently, it had never occurred to Rufus to break that tradition. Until now.

Now, he began to take an interest in his son. Perhaps he was only curious at first, but the boy captured him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>caught them together once in the library, the boy sitting on one of Rufus’s knees and studying a map that Rufus had just brought home. The map was spread on Rufus’s desk.

“Is this our river?” the boy was asking.

“No, that’s the Miles River, northeast of here. This map doesn’t show our river.”

“Why not?”

“It’s too small.”

“What is?” The boy peered up at him. “Our river or this map?”

“Both, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>suspect.”

“Let’s draw it in, then. Where does it go?”

Rufus hesitated. “Just about here. But we don’t have to draw it in.”

“Why? Don’t you want the map to be right?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>made a noise and Rufus looked up at me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought he looked almost ashamed for a moment. He put the boy down quickly and shooed him away.

“Nothing but questions,” Rufus complained to me.

“Enjoy it, Rufe. At least he’s not out setting fire to the stable or trying to drown himself.”

He couldn’t quite keep from laughing. “Alice said something like that.” He frowned a little. “She wants me to free him.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>nodded. Alice had already told me she meant to ask for the boy’s freedom.

“You put her up to it, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stared at him. “Rufe, if there’s a woman on the place who makes up her own mind, it’s Alice. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t put her up to a thing.”

“Well … now she’s got something else to make up her mind about.”

“What?”

“Nothing. Nothing to you. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just mean to make her earn what she wants for a change,” he said.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t get any more out of him than that. Eventually, though, Alice told me what he wanted.

“He wants me to like him,” she said with heavy contempt. “Or maybe even love him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think he wants me to be more like you!”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guarantee you he doesn’t.”

She closed her eyes. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t care what he wants. If <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought it would make him free my children, I’d try to do it. But he lies! And he won’t put it down on no paper.”

“He likes Joe,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “He ought to. Joe looks like a slightly darker version of him at that age. Anyway, he might decide on his own to free the boy.”

“And this one?” She patted her stomach. “And the others? He’ll make sure there’re others.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know. I’ll push him whenever <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>should have took Joe and tried to run before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got pregnant again.”

“You’re still thinking about running?”

“Wouldn’t you be if you didn’t have another way to get free?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>nodded.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t mean to spend my life here watching my children grow up as slaves and maybe get sold.”

“He wouldn’t …”

“You don’t know what he would do! He don’t treat you the way he treats me. When I’m strong again after <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>have this baby, I’m going.”

“With the baby?”

“You don’t think I’m going to leave it here, do you?”

“But … <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t see how you can make it.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know more now than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did when Isaac and me left. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can make it.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>drew a deep breath. “When the time comes, if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can help you, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>will.”

“Get me a bottle of laudanum,” she said.

“Laudanum!”

“I’ll have the baby to keep quiet. Old Mama won’t let me near her, but she likes you. Get it.”

“All right.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t like it. Didn’t like the idea of her trying to run with a baby and a small child, didn’t like the idea of her trying to run at all. But she was right. In her place, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have tried. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have tried sooner and gotten killed sooner, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have done it alone.

“You think about this awhile longer,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “You’ll get the laudanum and anything else <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can supply, but you think.”

“I’ve already thought.”

“Not enough. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shouldn’t say this, but think what’s going to happen if the dogs catch Joe, or if they pull you down and get the baby.”





12


The baby was a girl, born in the second month of the new year. She was her mother’s daughter, born darker skinned than Joe would probably ever be.

“’Bout time <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had a baby to look like me,” said Alice when she saw her.

“You could have at least tried for red hair,” said Rufus. He was there too, peering at the baby’s wrinkled little face, peering with even more concern at Alice’s face, sweat-streaked and weary.

For the first and only time, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw her smile at him—a real smile. No sarcasm, no ridicule. It silenced him for several seconds.

Carrie and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had helped with the birth. Now, we left quietly, both of us probably thinking the same thing. That if Alice and Rufus were going to make peace, finally, neither of us wanted to break their mood.

They called the baby Hagar. Rufus said that was the ugliest name he had ever heard, but it was Alice’s choice, and he let it stand. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought it was the most beautiful name <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had ever heard. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt almost free, half-free if such a thing was possible, half-way home. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was gleeful at first—secretly elated. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>even kidded Alice about the names she chose for her children. Joseph and Hagar. And the two others whose names <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought silently—Miriam and Aaron. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said, “Someday Rufus is going to get religion and read enough of the Bible to wonder about those children’s names.”

Alice shrugged. “If Hagar had been a boy, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have called her Ishmael. In the Bible, people might be slaves for a while, but they didn’t have to stay slaves.”

My mood was so good, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>almost laughed. But she wouldn’t have understood that, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t have explained. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>kept it all in somehow, and congratulated myself that the Bible wasn’t the only place where slaves broke free. Her names were only symbolic, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had more than symbols to remind me that freedom was possible—probable—and for me, very near.

Or was it?

Slowly, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>began to calm down. The danger to my family was past, yes. Hagar had been born. But the danger to me personally … the danger to me personally still walked and talked and sometimes sat with Alice in her cabin in the evening as she nursed Hagar. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was there with them a couple of times, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt like an intruder.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was not free. Not any more than Alice was, or her children with their names. In fact, it looked as though Alice might get free before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did. She caught me alone one evening and pulled me into her cabin. It was empty except for the sleeping Hagar. Joe was out collecting cuts and bruises from sturdier children.

“Did you get the laudanum?” she demanded.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>peered at her through the semidarkness. Rufus kept her well supplied with candles, but at the moment, the only light in the room came from the window and from a low fire over which two pots simmered. “Alice, are you sure you still want it?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw her frown. “Sure <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>want it! ’Course <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>want it! What’s the matter with you?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hedged a little. “It’s so soon … The baby’s only a few weeks old.”

“You get me that stuff so <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can leave when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>want to!”

“I’ve got it.”

“Give it to me!”

“Goddamnit, Alice, will you slow down! Look, you keep working on him the way you have been, and you can get whatever you want and live to enjoy it.”

To my surprise, her stony expression crumbled, and she began to cry. “He’ll never let any of us go,” she said. “The more you give him, the more he wants.” She paused, wiped her eyes, then added softly, “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got to go while <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>still can—before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turn into just what people call me.” She looked at me and did the thing that made her so much like Rufus, though neither of them recognized it. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got to go before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turn into what you are!” she said bitterly.

Sarah had cornered me once and said, “What you let her talk to you like that for? She can’t get away with it with nobody else.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t know. Guilt, maybe. In spite of everything, my life was easier than hers. Maybe <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried to make up for that by taking her abuse. Everything had its limits, though.

“You want my help, Alice, you watch your mouth!”

“Watch yours,” she mocked.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stared at her in astonishment, remembering, knowing exactly what she had overheard.

“If <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>talked to him the way you do, he’d have me hangin’ in the barn,” she said.

“If you go on talking to me the way you do, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>won’t care what he does to you.”

She looked at me for a long time without saying anything. Finally, she smiled. “You’ll care. And you’ll help me. Else, you’d have to see yourself for the white nigger you are, and you couldn’t stand that.”

Rufus never called my bluff. Alice did it automatically—and because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was bluffing, she got away with it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up and walked away from her. Behind me, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heard her laugh.

Some days later, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>gave her the laudanum. Later that same day, Rufus began talking about sending Joe to school up North when he was a little older.

“Do you mean to free the boy, Rufe?”

He nodded.

“Good. Tell Alice.”

“When <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>get around to it.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t argue with him; <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told her myself.

“It don’t matter what he says,” she told me. “Did he show you any free papers?”

“No.”

“When he does, and you read them to me, maybe I’ll believe him. I’m tellin’ you, he uses those children just the way you use a bit on a horse. I’m tired of havin’ a bit in my mouth.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t blame her. But still, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want her to go, didn’t want her to risk Joe and Hagar. Hell, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t even want her to risk herself. Elsewhere, under other circumstances, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would probably have disliked her. But here, we had a common enemy to unite us.





13


<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>planned to stay on the Weylin plantation long enough to see Alice leave, to find out whether she would be able to keep her freedom this time. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>managed to talk her into waiting until early summer to go. And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was prepared to wait that long myself before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried some dangerous trick that might get me home. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was homesick and Kevinsick and damned sick of Margaret Weylin’s floor and Alice’s mouth, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could wait a few more months. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>talked Rufus into letting me teach Nigel’s two older sons and the two children who served at the table along with Joe. Surprisingly, the children liked it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t recall having liked school much when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was their ages. Rufus liked it because Joe was as bright as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had said—bright and competitive. He had a head start on the others, and he didn’t intend to lose it.

“Why weren’t you like that about learning?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked Rufus.

“Don’t bother me,” he muttered.

Some of his neighbors found out what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was doing and offered him fatherly advice. It was dangerous to educate slaves, they warned. Education made blacks dissatisfied with slavery. It spoiled them for field work. The Methodist minister said it made them disobedient, made them want more than the Lord intended them to have. Another man said educating slaves was illegal. When Rufus replied that he had checked and that it wasn’t illegal in Maryland, the man said it should have been. Talk. Rufus shrugged it off without ever saying how much of it he believed. It was enough that he sided with me, and my school continued. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got the feeling that Alice was keeping him happy—and maybe finally enjoying herself a little in the process. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guessed from what she had told me that this was what was frightening her so, driving her away from the plantation, causing her to lash out at me. She was trying to deal with guilt of her own.

But she was waiting and using some discretion. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>relaxed, spent my spare moments trying to think of a way to get home. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want to depend on someone else’s chance violence again—violence that, if it came, could be more effective than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted.

Then Sam James stopped me out by the cookhouse and my complacency was brought to an end.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw him waiting for me beside the cookhouse door—a big young man. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>mistook him for Nigel at first. Then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>recognized him. Sarah had told me his name. He had spoken to me at the corn husking, and again at Christmas. Then Sarah had spoken to him for me and he had said nothing else. Until now.

“I’m Sam,” he said. “Remember at Christmas?”

“Yes. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought Sarah told you …”

“She did. Look, it ain’t that. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just wanted to see if maybe you’d teach my brother and sister to read.”

“Your … Oh. How old are they?”

“Sister was born the year you came here last … brother, the year before that.”

“I’ll have to get permission. Ask Sarah about it in a few days but don’t come to me again.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought of the expression <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had seen on Rufus’s face as he looked at this man. “Maybe I’m too cautious, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t want you getting in trouble because of me.”

He gave me a long searching look. “You want to be with that white man, girl?”

“If <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>were anywhere else, no black child on the place would be learning anything.”

“That ain’t what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>mean.”

“Yes it is. It’s all part of the same thing.”

“Some folks say …”

“Hold on.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was suddenly angry. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t want to hear what ‘some folks’ say. ‘Some folks’ let Fowler drive them into the fields every day and work them like mules.”

“Let him …?”

“Let him! They do it to keep the skin on their backs and breath in their bodies. Well, they’re not the only ones who have to do things they don’t like to stay alive and whole. Now you tell me why that should be so hard for ‘some folks’ to understand?”

He sighed. “That’s what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told them. But you better off than they are, so they get jealous.” He gave me another of his long searching looks. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>still say it’s too bad you already spoke for.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>grinned. “Get out of here, Sam. Field hands aren’t the only ones who can be jealous.”

He went. That was all. Innocent—completely innocent. But three days later, a trader led Sam away in chains.

Rufus never said a word to me. He didn’t accuse me of anything. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t have known Sam had been sold if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t glanced out the window of Margaret Weylin’s room and seen the coffle.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told Margaret some hasty lie, then ran out of her room, down the stairs, and out the door. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ran headlong into Rufus, and felt him steady me, hold me. The weakness that his dengue fever had left was finally gone. His grip was formidable.

“Get back in the house!” he hissed.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw Sam beyond him being chained into line. There were people a few feet away from him crying loudly. Two women, a boy and a girl. His family.

“Rufe,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>pleaded desperately, “don’t do this. There’s no need!”

He pushed me back toward the door and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>struggled against him.

“Rufe, please! Listen, he came to ask me to teach his brother and sister to read. That’s all!”

It was like talking to the wall of the house. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>managed to break away from him for a moment just as the younger of the two weeping women spotted me.

“You whore!” she screamed. She had not been permitted to approach the coffle, but she approached me. “You no-’count nigger whore, why couldn’t you leave my brother alone!”

She would have attacked me. And field hand that she was, strengthened by hard work, she would probably have given me the beating she thought <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>deserved. But Rufus stepped between us.

“Get back to work, Sally!”

She didn’t move, stood glaring at him until the older woman, probably her mother, reached her and pulled her away.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>caught Rufus by the hand and spoke low to him. “Please, Rufe. If you do this, you’ll destroy what you mean to preserve. Please don’t …”

He hit me.

It was a first, and so unexpected that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stumbled backward and fell.

And it was a mistake. It was the breaking of an unspoken agreement between us—a very basic agreement—and he knew it.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up slowly, watching him with anger and betrayal.

“Get in the house and stay there,” he said.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned my back and went to the cookhouse, deliberately disobeying. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could hear one of the traders say, “You ought to sell that one too. Troublemaker!”

At the cookhouse, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>heated water, got it warm, not hot. Then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took a basin of it up to the attic. It was hot there, and empty except for the pallets and my bag in its corner. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went over to it, washed my knife in antiseptic, and hooked the drawstring of my bag over my shoulder.

And in the warm water <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>cut my wrists.





The Rope


1


<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>awoke in darkness and lay still for several seconds trying to think where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was and when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had gone to sleep.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was lying on something unbelievably soft and comfortable …

My bed. Home. Kevin?

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could hear regular breathing beside me now. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat up and reached out to turn on the lamp—or <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried to. Sitting up made me faint and dizzy. For a moment, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought Rufus was pulling me back to him before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could even see home. Then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>became aware that my wrists were bandaged and throbbing—and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>remembered what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had done.

The lamp on Kevin’s side of the bed went on and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could see him beardless now, but with his thatch of gray hair uncut.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>lay flat and looked up at him happily. “You’re beautiful,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “You look a little like a heroic portrait <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw once of Andrew Jackson.”

“No way,” he said. “Man was skinny as hell. I’ve seen him.”

“But you haven’t seen my heroic portrait.”

“Why the hell did you cut your wrists? You could have bled to death! Or did you cut them yourself?”

“Yes. It got me home.”

“There must be a safer way.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>rubbed my wrists gingerly. “There isn’t any safe way to almost kill yourself. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was afraid of the sleeping pills. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took them with me because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted to be able to die if … if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted to die. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was afraid that if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>used them to get home, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might die before you or some doctor figured out what was wrong with me. Or that if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t die, I’d have some grisly side-effect—like gangrene.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>see,” he said after a while.

“Did you bandage me?”

“Me? No, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought this was too serious for me to handle alone. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped the bleeding as best <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could and called Lou George. He bandaged you.” Louis George was a doctor friend Kevin had met through his writing. Kevin had interviewed George for an article once, and the two had taken a liking to each other. They wound up doing a nonfiction book together.

“Lou said you managed to miss the main arteries in both arms,” Kevin told me. “Said you didn’t do much more than scratch yourself.”

“With all that blood!”

“It wasn’t that much. You were probably too frightened to cut as deeply as you could have.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sighed. “Well … <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess I’m glad <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t do much damage—as long as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got home.”

“How would you feel about seeing a psychiatrist?”

“Seeing a … Are you kidding?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>am, but Lou wasn’t. He says if you’re doing things like this, you need help.”

“Oh God. Do <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>have to? The lies I’d have to invent!”

“No, this time you probably won’t have to. Lou is a friend. You do it again, though, and … well, you could be locked up for psychiatric treatment whether you like it or not. The law tries to protect people like you from themselves.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found myself laughing, almost crying. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>put my head on his shoulder and wondered whether a little time in some sort of mental institution would be worse than several months of slavery. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>doubted it.

“How long was <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>gone this time?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked.

“About three hours. How long was it for you?”

“Eight months.”

“Eight …” He put his arm over me, holding me. “No wonder you cut your wrists.”

“Hagar has been born.”

“Has she?” There was silence for a moment, then, “What’s that going to mean?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>twisted uncomfortably and, by accident, put pressure on one of my wrists. The sudden pain made me gasp.

“Be careful,” he said. “Treat yourself gently for a change.”

“Where’s my bag?”

“Here.” He pulled the blanket aside and let me see that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was securely tied to my denim bag. “What are you going to do, Dana?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know.”

“What’s he like now?”

He. Rufus. He had become such a fixture in my life that it wasn’t even necessary to say his name. “His father died,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “He’s running things now.”

“Well?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know. How do you do well at owning and trading in slaves?”

“Not well,” Kevin decided. He got up and went to the kitchen, came back with a glass of water. “Did you want anything to eat? <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can get you something.”

“I’m not hungry.”

“What did he do to you, finally, to make you cut your wrists?”

“Nothing to me. Nothing important. He sold a man away from his family when there was no need for him to. He hit me when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>objected. Maybe he’ll never be as hard as his father was, but he’s a man of his time.”

“Then … it doesn’t seem to me that you have such a difficult decision ahead of you.”

“But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>talked to Carrie about it once, and she said …”

“Carrie?” He looked at me strangely.

“Yes. She said … Oh. She gets her meaning across, Kevin. Weren’t you around the place long enough to find that out?”

“She never tried to get much across to me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>used to wonder whether she was a little retarded.”

“God, no! Far from it. If you had gotten to know her, you wouldn’t even suspect.”

He managed to shrug. “Well, anyway, what did she tell you?”

“That if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had let Rufus die, everyone would have been sold. More families would have been separated. She has three children now.”

He was silent for several seconds. Then, “She might be sold with her children if they’re young. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>doubt that anyone would bother to keep her and her husband together. Someone would buy her and breed her to a new man. It is breeding, you know.”

“Yes. So you see, my decision isn’t as easy as you thought.”

“But … they’re being sold anyway.”

“Not all of them. Good Lord, Kevin, their lives are hard enough.”

“What about your life?”

“It’s better than anything most of them will ever know.”

“It may not be as he gets older.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat up, trying to ignore my own weakness. “Kevin, tell me what you want me to do.”

He looked away, said nothing. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>gave him several seconds, but he kept silent.

“It’s real now, isn’t it,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said softly. “We talked about it before—God knows how long ago—but somehow, it was abstract then. Now … Kevin, if you can’t even say it, how can you expect me to do it?”





2


We had fifteen full days together this time. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>marked them off on the calendar—June 19, through July 3. With some kind of reverse symbolism, Rufus called me back on July 4. But at least Kevin and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had a chance to grow back into the twentieth century. We didn’t seem to have to grow back into each other. The separations hadn’t been good for us, but they hadn’t hurt us that much either. It was easy for us to be together, knowing we shared experiences no one else would believe. It wasn’t as easy, though, for us to be with other people.

My cousin came over, and when Kevin answered the door, she didn’t recognize him.

“What’s the matter with him?” she whispered later when she and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>were alone.

“He’s been sick,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>lied.

“With what?”

“The doctor isn’t sure what it was. Kevin is much better now, though.”

“He looks just like my girl friend’s father did, and he had cancer.”

“Julie, for Godsake!”

“I’m sorry, but … never mind. He hasn’t hit you again, has he?”

“No.”

“Well, that’s something. You’d better take care of yourself. You don’t look so good either.”

Kevin tried driving—his first time after five years of horses and buggies. He said the traffic confused him, made him more nervous than he could see any reason for. He said he’d almost killed a couple of people. Then he put the car in the garage and left it there.

Of course, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t drive, wouldn’t even ride with someone else while there was still a chance of Rufus snatching me away. After the first week, though, Kevin began to doubt that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would be called again.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t doubt it. For the sake of the people whose lives Rufus controlled, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t wish him dead, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t rest easy until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew he was. As things stood now, sooner or later, he would get himself into trouble again and call me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>kept my denim bag nearby.

“You know, someday, you’re going to have to stop dragging that thing around with you and come back to life,” Kevin said after two weeks. He had just tried driving again, and when he came in, his hands were shaking. “Hell, half the time <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wonder if you’re not eager to go back to Maryland anyway.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been watching television—or at least, the television was on. Actually, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was looking over some journal pages <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had managed to bring home in my bag, wondering whether <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could weave them into a story. Now, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked up at Kevin. “Me?”

“Why not? Eight months, after all.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>put my journal pages down and got up to turn off the television.

“Leave it on,” said Kevin.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned it off. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think you’ve got something to say to me,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>should hear it clearly.”

“You don’t want to hear anything.”

“No, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t. But I’m going to, aren’t I?”

“My God, Dana, after two weeks …”

“It was eight days, time before last. And about three hours last time. The intervals between trips don’t mean anything.”

“How old was he last time?”

“He turned twenty-five when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was there last. And, though I’ll never be able to prove it, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned twenty-seven.”

“He’s grown up.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shrugged.

“Do you remember what he said just before he tried to shoot you?”

“No. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had other things on my mind.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had forgotten it myself, but it’s come back to me. He said, ‘You’re not going to leave me!’”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought for a moment. “Yes, that sounds about right.”

“It doesn’t sound right to me.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>mean it sounds like what he said! <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t have any control over what he says.”

“But still …” He paused, looked at me as though he expected me to say something. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t. “It sounded more like what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might say to you if you were leaving.”

“Would you?”

“You know what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>mean.”

“Say what you mean. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t answer you unless you say it.”

He drew a deep breath. “All right. You’ve said he was a man of his time, and you’ve told me what he’s done to Alice. What’s he done to you?”

“Sent me to the field, had me beaten, made me spend nearly eight months sleeping on the floor of his mother’s room, sold people … He’s done plenty, but the worst of it was to other people. He hasn’t raped me, Kevin. He understands, though you don’t seem to, that for him that would be a form of suicide.”

“You mean there’s something he could do to make you kill him, after all?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sighed, went over to him, and sat down on the arm of his chair. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked down at him. “Tell me you believe I’m lying to you.”

He looked at me uncertainly. “Look, if anything did happen, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could understand it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know how it was back then.”

“You mean you could forgive me for having been raped?”

“Dana, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>lived there. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know what those people were like. And Rufus’s attitude toward you …”

“Was sensible most of the time. He knew <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could kill him just by turning my back at the right moment. And he believed that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t have him because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>loved you. He said something like that once. He was wrong, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never told him so.”

“Wrong?”

“At least partly. Of course <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>love you, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t want anyone else. But there’s another reason, and when I’m back there it’s the most important reason. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t think Rufus would have understood it. Maybe you won’t either.”

“Tell me.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought for a moment, tried to find the right words. If <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could make him understand, then surely he would believe me. He had to believe. He was my anchor here in my own time. The only person who had any idea what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was going through.

“You know what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said, “when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw Tess tied into that coffle?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had told him about Tess and about Sam—that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had known them, that Rufus had sold them. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t told him the details though—especially not the details of Sam’s sale. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been trying for two weeks to avoid sending his thoughts in the direction they had taken now.

“What does Tess have to do with …?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought, that could be me—standing there with a rope around my neck waiting to be led away like someone’s dog!” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped, looked down at him, then went on softly. “I’m not property, Kevin. I’m not a horse or a sack of wheat. If <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>have to seem to be property, if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>have to accept limits on my freedom for Rufus’s sake, then he also has to accept limits—on his behavior toward me. He has to leave me enough control of my own life to make living look better to me than killing and dying.”

“If your black ancestors had felt that way, you wouldn’t be here,” said Kevin.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told you when all this started that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t have their endurance. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>still don’t. Some of them will go on struggling to survive, no matter what. I’m not like that.”

He smiled a little. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>suspect that you are.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shook my head. He thought <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was being modest or something. He didn’t understand.

Then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>realized that he had smiled. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked down at him questioningly.

He sobered. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to know.”

“And do you, now?”

“Yes.”

That felt like truth. It felt enough like truth for me not to mind that he had only half understood me.

“Have you decided what you’re going to do about Rufus?” he asked.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shook my head. “You know, it’s not only what will happen to the slaves that worries me … if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turn my back on him. It’s what might happen to me.”

“You’ll be finished with him.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might be finished period. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might not be able to get home.”

“Your coming home has never had anything to do with him. You come home when your life is in danger.”

“But how do <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>come home? Is the power mine, or do <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tap some power in him? All this started with him, after all. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know whether <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>need him or not. And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>won’t know until he’s not around.”

A couple of Kevin’s friends came over on the Fourth of July and tried to get us to go to the Rose Bowl with them for the fireworks. Kevin wanted to go—more to get out of the house than for any other reason, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>suspected. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told him to go ahead, but he wouldn’t go without me. As it turned out, there was no chance for me to go, anyway. As Kevin’s friends left the house, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>began to feel dizzy.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stumbled toward my bag, fell before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>reached it, crawled toward it, grabbed it just as Kevin came in from saying good-bye to his friends.

“Dana,” he was saying, “we can’t stay cooped up in this house any longer waiting for something that isn’t …”

He was gone.

Instead of lying on the floor of my living room, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was lying on the ground in the sun, almost directly over a hill of large black ants.

Before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could get up, someone kicked me, fell on me heavily. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had the breath knocked out of me for a moment.

“Dana!” said Rufus’s voice. “What the hell are you doing here?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked up, saw him sprawled across me where he had fallen. We got up just as something began to bite me—the ants, probably. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>brushed myself off quickly.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said what are you doing here!” He sounded angry. He looked no older than he had been when I’d last seen him, but something was wrong with him. He looked haggard and weary—looked as though it had been too long since he’d slept last, looked as though it would be even longer before he was able to sleep again.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know what I’m doing here, Rufe. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never do until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>find out what’s wrong with you.”

He stared at me for a long moment. His eyes were red and under them were dark smudges. Finally, he grabbed me by the arm and led me back the way he had come. We were on the plantation not far from the house. Nothing looked changed. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw two of Nigel’s sons wrestling, rolling around on the ground. They were the two <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been teaching, and they were no bigger than they had been when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw them last.

“Rufe, how long have <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>been gone?”

He didn’t answer. He was leading me toward the barn, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw, and apparently <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t going to learn anything until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got there.

He stopped at the barn door and pushed me through it. He didn’t follow me in.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked around, seeing very little at first as my eyes became accustomed to the dimmer light. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned to the place where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been strung up and whipped—and jumped back in surprise when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw that someone was hanging there. Hanging by the neck. A woman.

Alice.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stared at her not believing, not wanting to believe … <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>touched her and her flesh was cold and hard. The dead gray face was ugly in death as it had never been in life. The mouth was open. The eyes were open and staring. Her head was bare and her hair loose and short like mine. She had never liked to tie it up the way other women did. It was one of the things that had made us look even more alike—the only two consistently bareheaded women on the place. Her dress was dark red and her apron clean and white. She wore shoes that Rufus had had made specifically for her, not the rough heavy shoes or boots other slaves wore. It was as though she had dressed up and combed her hair and then …

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted her down.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked around, saw that the rope had been tied to a wall peg, thrown over a beam. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>broke my fingernails, trying to untie it until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>remembered my knife. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got it from my bag and cut Alice down.

She fell stiffly like something that would break when it hit the floor. But she landed without breaking and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took the rope from her neck and closed her eyes. For a time, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just sat with her, holding her head and crying silently.

Eventually, Rufus came in. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked up at him and he looked away.

“Did she do this to herself?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked.

“Yes. To herself.”

“Why?”

He didn’t answer.

“Rufe?”

He shook his head slowly from side to side.

“Where are her children?”

He turned and walked out of the barn.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>straightened Alice’s body and her dress and looked around for something to cover her with. There was nothing.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>left the barn and went across an expanse of grass to the cookhouse. Sarah was there chopping meat with that frightening speed and coordination of hers. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had told her once that it always looked as though she was about to cut off a finger or two, and she had laughed. She still had all ten.

“Sarah?” There was such a difference in our ages now that everyone else my age called her “Aunt Sarah.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew it was a title of respect in this culture, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>respected her. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t quite manage “Aunt” any more than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could have managed “Mammy.” She didn’t seem to mind.

She looked up. “Dana! Girl, what are you doing back here? What Marse Rufe done now?”

“I’m not sure. But, Sarah, Alice is dead.”

Sarah put down her cleaver and sat on the bench next to the table. “Oh Lord. Poor child. He finally killed her.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went over and sat beside her. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think she did it to herself. Hung herself. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just took her down.”

“He did it!” she hissed. “Even if he didn’t put the rope on her, he drove her to it. He sold her babies!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>frowned. Sarah had spoken clearly enough, loudly enough, but for a moment, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t understand. “Joe and Hagar? His children?”

“What he care ’bout that?”

“But … he did care. He was going to … Why would he do such a thing?”

“She run off.” Sarah faced me. “You must have known she was goin’. You and her was like sisters.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t need the reminder. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up, feeling that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to move around, distract myself, or <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would cry again.

“You sure fought like sisters,” said Sarah. “Always fussin’ at each other, stompin’ away from each other, comin’ back. Right after you left, she knocked the devil out of a field hand who was runnin’ you down.”

Had she? She would. Insulting me was her prerogative. No trespassing. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>paced from the table to the hearth to a small work table. Back to Sarah.

“Dana, where is she?”

“In the barn.”

“He’ll give her a big funeral.” Sarah shook her head. “It’s funny. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought she was finally settlin’ down with him—getting not to mind so much.”

“If she was, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t think she could have forgiven herself for it.”

Sarah shrugged.

“When she ran … did he beat her?”

“Not much. ’Bout much as old Marse Tom whipped you that time.”

That gentle spanking, yes.

“The whipping didn’t matter much. But when he took away her children, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought she was go’ die right there. She was screaming and crying and carrying on. Then she got sick and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to take care of her.” Sarah was silent for a moment. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want to even be close to her. When Marse Tom sold my babies, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just wanted to lay down and die. Seeing her like she was brought all that back.”

Carrie came in then, her face wet with tears. She came up to me without surprise, and hugged me.

“You know?” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked.

She nodded, then made her sign for white people and pushed me toward the door. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found Rufus at his desk in the library fondling a hand gun.

He looked up and saw me just as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was about to withdraw. It had occurred to me suddenly, certainly, that this was where he had been heading when he called me. What had his call been, then? A subconscious desire for me to stop him from shooting himself?

“Come in, Dana.” His voice sounded empty and dead.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>pulled my old Windsor chair up to his desk and sat down. “How could you do it, Rufe?”

He didn’t answer.

“Your son and your daughter … How could you sell them?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t.”

That stopped me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had been prepared for almost any other answer—or no answer. But a denial … “But … but …”

“She ran away.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know.”

“We were getting along. You know. You were here. It was good. Once, when you were gone, she came to my room. She came on her own.”

“Rufe …?”

“Everything was all right. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>even went on with Joe’s lessons. Me! <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told her <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would free both of them.”

“She didn’t believe you. You wouldn’t put anything into writing.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shrugged. “Where are the children, Rufe?”

“In Baltimore with my mother’s sister.”

“But … why?”

“To punish her, scare her. To make her see what could happen if she didn’t … if she tried to leave me.”

“Oh God! But you could have at least brought them back when she got sick.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wish <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had.”

“Why didn’t you?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>turned away from him in disgust. “You killed her. Just as though you had put that gun to her head and fired.”

He looked at the gun, put it down quickly.

“What are you going to do now?”

“Nigel’s gone to get a coffin. A decent one, not just a homemade box. And he’ll hire a minister to come out tomorrow.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>mean what are you going to do for your son and your daughter?”

He looked at me helplessly.

“Two certificates of freedom,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “You owe them that, at least. You’ve deprived them of their mother.”

“Damn you, Dana! Stop saying that! Stop saying <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>killed her.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>just looked at him.

“Why did you leave me! If you hadn’t gone, she might not have run away!”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>rubbed my face where he had hit me when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>begged him not to sell Sam.

“You didn’t have to go!”

“You were turning into something <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want to stay near.”

Silence.

“Two certificates of freedom, Rufe, all legal. Raise them free. That’s the least you can do.”

There was an outdoor funeral the next day. Everyone attended—field hands, house servants, even the indifferent Evan Fowler.

The minister was a tall coal-black deep-voiced freedman with a face that reminded me of a picture <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had of my father who had died before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was old enough to know him. The minister was literate. He held a Bible in his huge hands and read from Job and Ecclesiastes until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could hardly stand to listen. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had shrugged off my aunt and uncle’s strict Baptist teachings years before. But even now, especially now, the bitter melancholy words of Job could still reach me. “Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not …”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>kept quiet somehow, wiped away silent tears, beat away flies and mosquitoes, heard the whispers.

“She gone to hell! Don’t you know folks kills theyself goes to hell!”

“Shut your mouth! Marse Rufe’ll make you think you down there with her!”

Silence.

They buried her.

There was a big dinner afterward. My relatives at home had dinners after funerals too. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never thought about how far back the custom might go.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>ate a little, then went away to the library where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could be alone, where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would write. Sometimes <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wrote things because <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t say them, couldn’t sort out my feelings about them, couldn’t keep them bottled up inside me. It was a kind of writing <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>always destroyed afterward. It was for no one else. Not even Kevin.

Rufus came in later when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was nearly written out. He came to the desk, sat down in my old Windsor—<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was in his chair—and put his head down. We didn’t say anything, but we sat together for a while.

The next day, he took me to town with him, took me to the old brick Court House, and let me watch while he had certificates of freedom drawn up for his children.

“If <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>bring them back,” he said on the ride home, “will you take care of them?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shook my head. “It wouldn’t be good for them, Rufe. This isn’t my home. They’d get used to me, then I’d be gone.”

“Who, then?”

“Carrie. Sarah will help her.”

He nodded listlessly.

Early one morning a few days later, he left for Easton Point where he could catch a steamboat to Baltimore. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>offered to go with him to help with the children, but all that got me was a look of suspicion—a look <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t help understanding.

“Rufe, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t have to go to Baltimore to escape from you. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>really want to help.”

“Just stay here,” he said. And he went out to talk to Evan Fowler before he left. He knew how <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had gone home last. He had asked me, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had told him.

“But why?” he had demanded. “You could have killed yourself.”

“There’re worse things than being dead,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had said.

He had turned and walked away from me.

Now he watched more than he had before. He couldn’t watch me all the time, of course, and unless he wanted to keep me chained, he couldn’t prevent me from taking one route or another out of his world if that was what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted to do. He couldn’t control me. That clearly bothered him.

Evan Fowler was in the house more than he had to be while Rufus was gone. He said little to me, gave me no orders. But he was there. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>took refuge in Margaret Weylin’s room, and she was so pleased she talked endlessly. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found myself laughing and actually holding conversations with her as though we were just a couple of lonely people talking without the extra burden of stupid barriers.

Rufus came back, came to the house carrying the dark little girl and leading the boy who seemed to look even more like him. Joe saw me in the hall and ran to me.

“Aunt Dana, Aunt Dana!” And a hug later, “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can read better now. Daddy’s been teaching me. Wanna hear?”

“Sure <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>do.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked up at Rufus. Daddy?

He glared at me tight-lipped as though daring me to speak. All <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had wanted to say, though, was, “What took you so long?” The boy had spent his short life calling his father “Master.” Well, now that he no longer had a mother, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>supposed Rufus thought it was time he had a father. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>managed to smile at Rufus—a real smile. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want him feeling embarrassed or defensive for finally acknowledging his son.

He smiled back, seemed to relax.

“How about my getting classes going again?”

He nodded. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess the others haven’t had time to forget much.”

They hadn’t. As it turned out, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had only been away for three months. The children had had a kind of early summer vacation. Now they went back to school. And I, slowly, delicately, went to work on Rufus, began to push him toward freeing a few more of them, perhaps several more of them—perhaps in his will, all of them. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had heard of slaveholders doing such things. The Civil War was still thirty years away. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might be able to get some of the adult slaves freed while they were still young enough to build new lives. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>might be able to do some good for everyone, finally. At least, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt secure enough to try, now that my own freedom was within reach.

Rufus had been keeping me with him more than he needed me now. He called me to share his meals openly, and he seemed to listen when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>talked to him about freeing the slaves. But he made no promises. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wondered whether he thought making a will was foolish at his age—or maybe it was freeing more slaves that he thought was foolish. He didn’t say anything, so <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t tell.

Finally, though, he did answer me, told me much more than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wanted to know. None of it should have surprised me at all.

“Dana,” he said one afternoon in the library, “I’d have to be crazy to make a will freeing these people and then tell you about it. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could die damn young for that kind of craziness.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to look at him to see whether he was serious. But looking at him confused me even more. He was smiling, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got the feeling he was completely serious. He believed <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would kill him to free his slaves. Strangely, the idea had not occurred to me. My suggestion had been innocent. But he might have a point. Eventually, it would have occurred to me.

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>used to have nightmares about you,” he said. “They started when <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was little—right after <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>set fire to the draperies. Remember the fire?”

“Of course.”

“I’d dream about you and wake up in a cold sweat.”

“Dream … about me killing you?”

“Not exactly.” He paused, gave me a long unreadable look. “I’d dream about you leaving me.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>frowned. That was close to the thing Kevin had heard him say—the thing that had awakened Kevin’s suspicions. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>leave,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said carefully. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>have to. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t belong here.”

“Yes you do! As far as I’m concerned, you do. But that’s not what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>mean. You leave, and sooner or later you come back. But in my nightmares, you leave without helping me. You walk away and leave me in trouble, hurting, maybe dying.”

“Oh. Are you sure those dreams started when you were little? They sound more like something you would have come up with after your fight with Isaac.”

“They got worse then,” he admitted. “But they started way back at the fire—as soon as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>realized you could help me or not, just as you chose. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had those nightmares for years. Then when Alice had been here awhile, they went away. Now they’ve come back.”

He stopped, looked at me as though he expected me to say something—to reassure him, perhaps, to promise him that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would never do such a thing. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t quite bring myself to say the words.

“You see?” he said quietly.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>moved uncomfortably in my chair. “Rufe, do you know how many people live to ripe old ages without ever getting into the kind of trouble that causes you to need me? If you don’t trust me, then you have more reason than ever to be careful.”

“Tell me <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can trust you.”

More discomfort. “You keep doing things that make it impossible for me to trust you—even though you know it has to work both ways.”

He shook his head. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never know how to treat you. You confuse everybody. You sound too white to the field hands—like some kind of traitor, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know what they think.”

“Daddy always thought you were dangerous because you knew too many white ways, but you were black. Too black, he said. The kind of black who watches and thinks and makes trouble. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told that to Alice and she laughed. She said sometimes Daddy showed more sense than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did. She said he was right about you, and that I’d find out some day.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>jumped. Had Alice really said such a thing?

“And my mother,” continued Rufus calmly, “says if she closes her eyes while you and her are talking, she can forget you’re black without even trying.”

“I’m black,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “And when you sell a black man away from his family just because he talked to me, you can’t expect me to have any good feelings toward you.”

He looked away. We hadn’t really discussed Sam before. We had talked around him, alluded to him without quite mentioning him.

“He wanted you,” said Rufus bluntly.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stared at him, knowing now why we hadn’t spoken of Sam. It was too dangerous. It could lead to speaking of other things. We needed safe subjects now, Rufus and I—the price of corn, supplies for the slaves, that sort of thing.

“Sam didn’t do anything,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “You sold him for what you thought he was thinking.”

“He wanted you,” Rufus repeated.

So do you, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought. No Alice to take the pressure off any more. It was time for me to go home. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>started to get up.

“Don’t leave, Dana.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stopped. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want to hurry away—run away—from him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t want to give him any indication that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was going to the attic to reopen the tender new scar tissue at my wrists. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sat down again. And he leaned back in his chair and looked at me until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wished <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had taken the chance of hurrying away.

“What am <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>going to do when you go home this time?” he whispered.

“You’ll survive.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wonder … why <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>should bother.”

“For your children, at least,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “Her children. They’re all you have left of her.”

He closed his eyes, rubbed one hand over them. “They should be your children now,” he said. “If you had any feelings for them, you’d stay.”

For them? “You know <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t.”

“You could if you wanted to. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t hurt you, and you wouldn’t have to hurt yourself … again.”

“You wouldn’t hurt me until something frustrated you, made you angry or jealous. You wouldn’t hurt me until someone hurt you. Rufe, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know you. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t stay here even if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t have a home to go back to—and someone waiting for me there.”

“That Kevin!”

“Yes.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wish <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had shot him.”

“If you had, you’d be dead yourself by now.”

He turned his body so that he faced me squarely. “You say that as though it means something.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got up to leave. There was nothing more to be said. He had asked for what he knew <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could not give, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had refused.

“You know, Dana,” he said softly, “when you sent Alice to me that first time, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>saw how much she hated me, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought, I’ll fall asleep beside her and she’ll kill me. She’ll hit me with a candlestick. She’ll set fire to the bed. She’ll bring a knife up from the cookhouse …

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought all that, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t afraid. Because if she killed me, that would be that. Nothing else would matter. But if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>lived, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have her. And, by God, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to have her.”

He stood up and came over to me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>stepped back, but he caught my arms anyway. “You’re so much like her, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can hardly stand it,” he said.

“Let go of me, Rufe!”

“You were one woman,” he said. “You and her. One woman. Two halves of a whole.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to get away from him. “Let me go, or I’ll make your dream real!” Abandonment. The one weapon Alice hadn’t had. Rufus didn’t seem to be afraid of dying. Now, in his grief, he seemed almost to want death. But he was afraid of dying alone, afraid of being deserted by the person he had depended on for so long.

He stood holding my arms, perhaps trying to decide what he should do. After a moment, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt his grip loosen, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>pulled away. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to go now before he submerged his fear. He could do it. He could talk himself into anything.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>left the library, went up the main stairs, then the attic stairs. Over to my bag, my knife …

Footsteps on the stairs.

The knife!

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>opened it, hesitated, then slipped the knife, blade still open, back into my bag.

He opened the door, came in, looked around the big hot empty room. He saw me at once, but still, he looked around—to see whether we were alone?

We were.

He came over and sat next to me on my pallet. “I’m sorry, Dana,” he said.

Sorry? For what he had nearly done, or for what he was about to do? Sorry. He had apologized to me many times in many ways before, but his apologies had always been oblique, “Eat with me, Dana. Sarah is cooking up something special.” Or, “Here, Dana, here’s a new book <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>bought for you in town.” Or, “Here’s some cloth, Dana. Maybe you can make yourself something from it.”

Things. Gifts given when he knew he had hurt or offended me. But he had never before said, “I’m sorry, Dana.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at him uncertainly.

“I’ve never felt so lonesome in my life,” he said.

The words touched me as no others could have. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew about loneliness. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>found my thoughts going back to the time <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had gone home without Kevin—the loneliness, the fear, sometimes the hopelessness <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had felt then. Hopelessness wouldn’t be a sometime thing to Rufus, though. Alice was dead and buried. He had only his children left. But at least one of them had also loved Alice. Joe.

“Where’d my mama go?” he demanded on his first day home.

“Away,” Rufus had said. “She went away.”

“When is she coming back?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know.”

The boy came to me. “Aunt Dana, where’d my mama go?”

“Honey … she died.”

“Died?”

“Yes. Like old Aunt Mary.” Who at last had drifted the final distance to her reward. She had lived over eighty years—had come over from Africa, people said. Nigel had made a box and Mary had been laid to rest near where Alice lay now.

“But Mama wasn’t old.”

“No, she was sick, Joe.”

“Daddy said she went away.”

“Well … to heaven.”

“No!”

He had cried and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had tried to comfort him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>remembered the pain of my own mother’s death—grief, loneliness, uncertainty in my aunt and uncle’s house …

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had held the boy and told him he still had his daddy—please God. And that Sarah and Carrie and Nigel loved him. They wouldn’t let anything happen to him—as though they had the power to protect him, or even themselves.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>let Joe go to his mother’s cabin to be alone for a while. He wanted to. Then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>told Rufus what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had done. And Rufus hadn’t known whether to hit me or thank me. He had glared at me, the skin of his face drawn tight, intense. Then, finally, he had relaxed and nodded and gone out to find his son.

Now, he sat with me—being sorry and lonely and wanting me to take the place of the dead.

“You never hated me, did you?” he asked.

“Never for long. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know why. You worked hard to earn my hatred, Rufe.”

“She hated me. From the first time <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>forced her.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t blame her.”

“Until just before she ran. She had stopped hating me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wonder how long it will take you.”

“What?”

“To stop hating.”

Oh God. Almost against my will, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>closed my fingers around the handle of the knife still concealed in my bag. He took my other hand, held it between his own in a grip that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>knew would only be gentle until <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>tried to pull away.

“Rufe,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said, “your children …”

“They’re free.”

“But they’re young. They need you to protect their freedom.”

“Then it’s up to you, isn’t it?”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>twisted my hand, tried to get it away from him in sudden anger. At once, his hold went from caressing to imprisoning. My right hand had become wet and slippery on the knife.

“It’s up to you,” he repeated.

“No, Goddamnit, it isn’t! Keeping you alive has been up to me for too long! Why didn’t you shoot yourself when you started to? <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wouldn’t have stopped you!”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know.”

The softness of his voice made me look up at him.

“So what else do <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>have to lose?” he asked. He pushed me back on the pallet, and for a few moments, we lay there, still. What was he waiting for? What was <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>waiting for?

He lay with his head on my shoulder, his left arm around me, his right hand still holding my hand, and slowly, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>realized how easy it would be for me to continue to be still and forgive him even this. So easy, in spite of all my talk. But it would be so hard to raise the knife, drive it into the flesh <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had saved so many times. So hard to kill …

He was not hurting me, would not hurt me if <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>remained as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was. He was not his father, old and ugly, brutal and disgusting. He smelled of soap, as though he had bathed recently—for me? The red hair was neatly combed and a little damp. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would never be to him what Tess had been to his father—a thing passed around like the whiskey jug at a husking. He wouldn’t do that to me or sell me or …

No.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could feel the knife in my hand, still slippery with perspiration. A slave was a slave. Anything could be done to her. And Rufus was Rufus—erratic, alternately generous and vicious. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could accept him as my ancestor, my younger brother, my friend, but not as my master, and not as my lover. He had understood that once.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>twisted sharply, broke away from him. He caught me, trying not to hurt me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was aware of him trying not to hurt me even as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>raised the knife, even as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>sank it into his side.

He screamed. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never heard anyone scream that way—an animal sound. He screamed again, a lower ugly gurgle.

He lost his hold on my hand for a moment, but caught my arm before <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could get away. Then he brought up the fist of his free hand to punch me once, and again as the patroller had done so long ago.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>pulled the knife free of him somehow, raised it, and brought it down again into his back.

This time he only grunted. He collapsed across me, somehow still alive, still holding my arm.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>lay beneath him, half conscious from the blows, and sick. My stomach seemed to twist, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>vomited on both of us.

“Dana?”

A voice. A man’s voice.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>managed to turn my head and see Nigel standing in the doorway.

“Dana, what …? Oh no. God, no!”

“Nigel …” moaned Rufus, and he gave a long shuddering sigh. His body went limp and leaden across me. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>pushed him away somehow—everything but his hand still on my arm. Then <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>convulsed with terrible, wrenching sickness.

Something harder and stronger than Rufus’s hand clamped down on my arm, squeezing it, stiffening it, pressing into it—painlessly, at first—melting into it, meshing with it as though somehow my arm were being absorbed into something. Something cold and nonliving.

Something … paint, plaster, wood—a wall. The wall of my living room. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was back at home—in my own house, in my own time. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was still caught somehow, joined to the wall as though my arm were growing out of it—or growing into it. From the elbow to the ends of the fingers, my left arm had become a part of the wall. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked at the spot where flesh joined with plaster, stared at it uncomprehending. It was the exact spot Rufus’s fingers had grasped.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>pulled my arm toward me, pulled hard.

And suddenly, there was an avalanche of pain, red impossible agony! And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>screamed and screamed.





Epilogue


We flew to Maryland as soon as my arm was well enough. There, we rented a car—Kevin was driving again, finally—and wandered around Baltimore and over to Easton. There was a bridge now, not the steamship Rufus had used. And at last <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>got a good look at the town <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had lived so near and seen so little of. We found the courthouse and an old church, a few other buildings time had not worn away. And we found Burger King and Holiday Inn and Texaco and schools with black kids and white kids together and older people who looked at Kevin and me, then looked again.

We went into the countryside, into what was still woods and farmland, and found a few of the old houses. A couple of them could have been the Weylin house. They were well-kept and handsomer, but basically, they were the same red-brick Georgian Colonials.

But Rufus’s house was gone. As nearly as we could tell, its site was now covered by a broad field of corn. The house was dust, like Rufus.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was the one who insisted on trying to find his grave, questioning the farmer about it because Rufus, like his father, like old Mary and Alice, had probably been buried on the plantation.

But the farmer knew nothing—or at least, said nothing. The only clue we found—more than a clue, really—was an old newspaper article—a notice that Mr. Rufus Weylin had been killed when his house caught fire and was partially destroyed. And in later papers, notice of the sale of the slaves from Mr. Rufus Weylin’s estate. These slaves were listed by their first names with their approximate ages and their skills given. All three of Nigel’s sons were listed, but Nigel and Carrie were not. Sarah was listed, but Joe and Hagar were not. Everyone else was listed. Everyone.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought about that, put together as many pieces as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could. The fire, for instance. Nigel had probably set it to cover what <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had done—and he had covered. Rufus was assumed to have burned to death. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could find nothing in the incomplete newspaper records to suggest that he had been murdered, or even that the fire had been arson. Nigel must have done a good job. He must also have managed to get Margaret Weylin out of the house alive. There was no mention of her dying. And Margaret had relatives in Baltimore. Also, Hagar’s home had been in Baltimore.

Kevin and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went back to Baltimore to skim newspapers, legal records, anything we could find that might tie Margaret and Hagar together or mention them at all. Margaret might have taken both children. Perhaps with Alice dead she had accepted them. They were her grandchildren, after all, the son and daughter of her only child. She might have cared for them. She might also have held them as slaves. But even if she had, Hagar, at least, lived long enough for the Fourteenth Amendment to free her.

“He could have left a will,” Kevin told me outside one of our haunts, the Maryland Historical Society. “He could have freed those people at least when he had no more use for them.”

“But there was his mother to consider,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said. “And he was only twenty-five. He probably thought he had plenty of time to make a will.”

“Stop defending him,” muttered Kevin.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hesitated, then shook my head. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wasn’t. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess in a way, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was defending myself. You see, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know why he wouldn’t make that kind of will. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>asked him, and he told me.”

“Why?”

“Because of me. He was afraid I’d kill him afterwards.”

“You wouldn’t even have had to know about it!”

“Yes, but <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>guess he wasn’t taking any chances.”

“Was he right … to be afraid?”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>doubt it, considering what you took from him. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t think you were really capable of killing him until he attacked you.”

And barely then, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>thought. Kevin would never know what those last moments had been like. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had outlined them for him, and he’d asked few questions. For that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was grateful. Now <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>said simply, “Self-defense.”

“Yes,” he said.

“But the cost … Nigel’s children, Sarah, all the others …”

“It’s over,” he said. “There’s nothing you can do to change any of it now.”

“<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know.” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>drew a deep breath. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>wonder whether the children were allowed to stay together—maybe stay with Sarah.”

“You’ve looked,” he said. “And you’ve found no records. You’ll probably never know.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>touched the scar Tom Weylin’s boot had left on my face, touched my empty left sleeve. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>know,” <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>repeated. “Why did <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>even want to come here. You’d think <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>would have had enough of the past.”

“You probably needed to come for the same reason <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>did.” He shrugged. “To try to understand. To touch solid evidence that those people existed. To reassure yourself that you’re sane.”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>looked back at the brick building of the Historical Society, itself a converted early mansion. “If we told anyone else about this, anyone at all, they wouldn’t think we were so sane.”

“We are,” he said. “And now that the boy is dead, we have some chance of staying that way.”

First-person American slave narratives should have ceased being written when the last American citizen born into institutionalized slavery died. But the literary form has persisted, just as the legacy of slavery has persisted, into the present. The second half of the twentieth century saw the rise of what has been christened the “neo-slave narrative,” a fictional mutation of the autobiographies of nineteenth-century Americans who lived as slaves. Among the many historical novels, often with first-person narrators, that have recreated the era of slavery, some of the best known are Margaret Walker’s Jubilee (1966), David Bradley’s The Chaneysville Incident (1981), Sherley Anne Williams’s Dessa Rose (1986), Ton<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>Morrison’s Beloved (1987), and Charles R. Johnson’s Middle Passage (1990). Octavia Butler’s hybrid of memoir and fantasy is a distinctive contribution to the genre of neo-slave narrative. Although Kindred is not itself a work of science fiction, Butler has brought to the creation of this narrative the sensibilities of an author who works largely outside the tradition of realism. When Kindred first appeared in 1979, no one had thought of using the fictional conventions of time travel to transport a modern African American to an antebellum plantation. Time-traveling narratives are always replete with paradoxical questions: If you travel back a century and a half and kill your own great-great-grandfather, can you yourself ever be born? Is it as possible for the future to influence the past as it is for the past to shape the future? But then every good work of fiction is paradoxical: It lies like the truth.

Kindred begins and ends in mystery. On June 9, 1976, her twenty-sixth birthday, Edana Franklin is overcome by nausea while moving with her white husband, Kevin, into a new house in the Los Angeles suburbs. Abruptly she finds herself kneeling on a riverbank, hears a child screaming, runs into the river to save him, performs artificial respiration, and as the boy begins breathing she looks up into a rifle barrel. Again she sickens and finds herself back once more in her new house, but soaking wet and covered in mud. She has not hallucinated; she has been transported, physically as well as psychically. This inexplicable, nightmarish transit from one place to another is the first of six such episodes of varying duration that make up the bulk of the novel. Sometimes Dana (the shortened form of her name she prefers) is transported alone, sometimes with Kevin; but the dizzy spells that immediately precede her movements occur without warning, and she is returned to Los Angeles only when she believes her life is threatened. The second time this happens, Dana discovers that she is moving not simply through space but into the past as well—to the Maryland plantation of a slave owner who is her own distant ancestor.

Dana’s involuntary trips to the past, like convulsive memories dislocating her in time, occupy only a few minutes or hours of her life in 1976, but her stay in the alternative time is stretched as she lives out an imposed remembrance of things past. Because of this dual time level a brief absence from Los Angeles may result in months spent in the nineteenth century, observing and suffering the backbreaking field work, enduring verbal abuse, whippings, and other daily brutalities of enslavement. Rufus Weylin, the child Dana rescues from drowning on her first trip to her ancestral home, periodically “calls” her from the present, whenever his life is in danger. As he grows older he becomes more repugnant and dangerous, but she must try to keep him alive until he and a slave woman named Alice Greenwood conceive a child, Hagar, who will initiate Dana’s own family line. Only upon Weylin’s death can Dana return permanently to 1976, but she comes back without her left arm. This is the shocking premise on which Kindred depends, and the author makes no effort to rationalize it. That is, Butler does not attempt to explain what she describes so graphically at the end of the sixth chapter: How could Dana’s arm, from the elbow down, be physically joined to the plaster of her living room wall? The author is silent on the process by which Dana’s arm is severed in the twilight zone between past and present. Kindred, one could say, is no more rational, no more comfortably explicable than the history of slavery itself. But that is a little too easy. The fiction has a ruthless logic to its design, and in an interview Butler has stated that the meaning of the amputation is clear enough: “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t really let her come all the way back. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t let her return to what she was, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t let her come back whole and that, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think, really symbolizes her not coming back whole. Antebellum slavery didn’t leave people quite whole.”1

Time damages as well as heals, and genuine historical understanding of human crimes is never easy and always achieved at the price of suffering. The loss of Dana’s arm becomes, as Ruth Salvaggio has suggested, “a kind of birthmark,” the emblem of a “disfigured heritage.”2 The symbolic meanings Kindred yields are powerful and readily articulable even if the literal truth is harder to state. It is the paradoxes of kinship, of family, of history, of home that engage Butler’s imagination, not the paradoxes of time travel. In particular, the novel has much to say about the paradoxical nature of “home,” that magnet for American sentiment and homilies: “There’s no place like home”; “Home is where the heart is”; “You can’t go home again.” To all of those simplicities Kindred offers a challenge. By the time Dana’s time traveling finally stops and she is restored to her Los Angeles home in 1976, the meaning of a homecoming has become impossibly complicated. Her first act, once her arm has sufficiently healed, is to fly to present-day Maryland; both her California house and the Weylin plantation have become inescapably “home” to her.3

None of this reads like the classic time-travel stories of science fiction. In The Time Machine (1895) H. G. Wells had his traveler display the shiny vehicle on which he rode into the future to verify the strange truth of his journey; in Kindred the method of transport remains a fantastic given. An irresistible psycho-historical force, not a feat of engineering, motivates Butler’s plot. How Dana travels in time is a problem of physics irrelevant to Butler’s aims. Kindred has far less in common with Wellsian science fiction than it has with that classic fable of alienation, Kafka’s Metamorphosis, whose protagonist simply wakes up one morning as a giant beetle, a fantastic eruption into the normal world. Butler has sacrificed the neat closure that a scientific—or even pseudo-scientific—explanation of time travel would have given her novel. Leaving the book’s ending rough-edged and raw like Dana’s wound, Butler leaves the reader uneasy and disturbed by the intersection of story and history rather than reassured by a tale that solves all the mysteries. She did not need to show off a technological marvel of the sort Wells provided to mark his traveler’s path through time; instead, Kindred evokes the terrifying and nauseating voyage that looms behind every American slave narrative: the Middle Passage from Africa to the slave markets of the New World. In her experience of being kidnapped in time and space, Dana recapitulates the dreadful, disorienting voyage of her ancestors, just as her employment in 1976 through a temporary job agency—“We regulars called it a slave market,” Dana says with grouchy irony (p. 52)—operates as a benign, ghostly version of institutional slavery’s auction block.

In many ways Kindred, set in a historical past scrupulously researched by the author, departs from Butler’s characteristic kind of fiction. With the exception of Wild Seed (1980), all her other novels, from Patternmaster (1975) through Parable of the Talents (1998), have been situated in the future, often a damaged future, and have focused on power relationships between “normal” human beings and human mutants or extrasolar aliens. But if Kindred has some surface differences from the rest of Butler’s fiction, at its deepest levels it is a central text in her exploration of the webs of power and affection in human relationships, of the ethical imperative and the emotional price of empathy, of the difficult struggle to move beyond alienation to connection. In all her fiction she has produced parables that speak to issues of cultural difference, whether sexual, racial, political, economic, or psychological, and to issues of mastery and self-mastery. Kindred shares imagery with Butler’s futuristic novels, in particular with Parable of the Talents, whose electronically controlled collars and neurological “lashings” are but science-fictional extrapolations of the plantation owners’ coffles and whippings. In both novels the degradations of slavery are a constant, as is the determination of the victims whose lives are under total control to resist and escape. But Kindred is technically a much sparer story, without the multiple narrative perspectives of the later book, and without any of the conceptual or technological apparatus usually associated with science fiction. Apart from its single fantastic premise of instantaneous movement through time and space, Kindred is consistently matter-of-fact in presentation and depends on the author’s reading of authentic slave narratives, her assimilation of data from research at libraries and historical societies, the maps she used to plot her characters’ movements, and her visits to the Talbot County, Maryland, sites of the novel. Butler herself has repeatedly insisted that Kindred should be read as a “grim fantasy,” not as science fiction, since there is “absolutely no science in it.” She has also remarked that such generic labels are often more useful as marketing categories than as reading protocols.4 Like Kafka’s Metamorphosis or Anna Kavan’s Ice, Butler’s novel is an experiment that resists easy classification, and like other neo-slave narratives it blurs the usual boundaries of genre.





II


When she enrolled in a summer workshop for novice science-fiction writers in 1970 at the age of twenty-three, Octavia Estelle Butler took a decisive step toward satisfying an ambition she had cherished since she was ten. An only child whose father died when she was a baby, Butler was aware very early of women struggling to survive. Her maternal grandmother told stories of unrelenting labor in the canefields of Louisiana while raising seven children. Her mother, Octavia M. Butler, had been working since the age of ten and spent all her adult life earning a living as a housemaid. As the author told Veronica Mixon in an interview just before Kindred appeared, the experiences of the women in her family influenced her youthful reading and her earliest efforts at writing: “Their lives seemed so terrible to me at times—so devoid of joy or reward. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>needed my fantasies to shield me from their world.”5 The powerful imaginative impulse that produced Kindred had its first test runs in the escapist fantasies of a child who needed to find or invent alternative realties. By temperament and by virtue of her strict Baptist upbringing, Butler was reclusive; imaginary worlds solaced her against the pinched rewards of the actual world, and books took the place of friends. From the age of six the public library became her second home and writing became her “positive obsession.”6

Kindred, however, is anything but an escapist fantasy. If as a girl Butler needed to put some distance between herself and the soul-shrinking realities of her mother’s life, she nevertheless always had her eyes open. What she saw as a child she later confronted and reshaped as a novelist. When her mother couldn’t find or afford a babysitter, young Octavia was often taken along to work. Even then she observed the long arm of slavery: the degree to which her mother operated in white society as an invisible woman and, alarmingly, the degree to which she accepted and internalized her status. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>used to see her going in back doors, being talked about while she was standing right there and basically being treated like a non-person, something beneath notice…. And <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could see her later as <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>grew up. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could see her absorbing more of what she was hearing from the whites than <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>think even she would have wanted to absorb.” At the time she blamed her mother’s employers less than her mother for allowing herself to be demeaned.7

Some of these childhood memories infiltrated the fiction she produced in her maturity; certainly they shaped her purpose in Kindred in imagining the privations of earlier generations of black Americans who were in danger of being forgotten by the black middle class as well as ignored by white Americans. While a student at Pasadena City College, Butler heard a bright male classmate carrying on about being held back by his parents and wanting to kill off the older generations of African Americans. He knew a lot about black history “but he didn’t feel it in his gut,” she thought. It brought back to her mind her own earlier anger over her mother’s cultivated deafness to the insults of her employers. At that moment, she later said, the idea for Kindred came to her.8 Butler’s effort to recover something of the experiences of the nineteenth-century ancestors of those who, like herself and her college classmate, had come of age during the Civil Rights and Black Power movements was an homage both to those women in her family who still struggled for an identity and to those more distant relations whose identities had been lost. “So many relatives that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had never known, would never know” (p. 28), Dana muses sadly early on in Kindred as she thinks of the bare names inked in her family Bible.

Although Dana’s experiences when she is hurled into the midst of slave society are full of terror and pain, they also illuminate her past and fresh-en her understanding of those generations forced to be non-persons. One of the protagonist’s—and Butler’s—achievements in traveling to the past is to see individual slaves as people rather than as encrusted literary or sociological types. Perhaps most impressive is Sarah the cook, the stereotypical “mammy” of books and films, whose apparent acceptance of humiliation, Dana comes to understand, masks a deep anger over the master’s sale of nearly all her children: “She was the kind of woman who would be held in contempt during the militant nineteen sixties. The house-nigger, the handkerchief-head, the female Uncle Tom—the frightened powerless woman who had already lost all she could stand to lose, and who knew as little about the freedom of the North as she knew about the hereafter” (p. 145). Here we see literary fantasy in the service of the recovery of historical and psychological realities. As fictional memoir, Kindred is Butler’s contribution to the literature of memory every bit as much as it is an exercise in the fantastic imagination.

The artfulness of Kindred is the product of a single-minded and largely isolated literary apprenticeship. In her younger years Butler lived for her trips to the library, but her family paid little attention to what she read. Her teachers were unreceptive to the science-fiction stories she occasionally submitted in English classes. Her schoolmates also found her tastes in reading and writing strange and, increasingly, Butler kept her literary interests to herself. In adolescence she immersed herself in the science-fictional worlds of Theodore Sturgeon, Leigh Brackett, and Ray Bradbury, and the absence of black women writers from the genre did not deter her own ambitions: “Frankly, it never occurred to me that <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>needed someone who looked like me to show me the way. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was ignorant and arrogant and persistent and the writing left me no choice at all.”9

In the 1940s and 1950s no black writers and almost no women were visibly publishing science fiction. Not surprisingly, few black readers — and, we can assume, very few black girls—found much to interest them in the science fiction of the period, geared as it was toward white adolescent boys. Some of it was provocatively racist, including Robert Heinlein’s The Sixth Column (1949), whose heroic protagonist in a future race war was unsubtly named Whitey. The highest honor available for a character of color in such novels was sacrificing his life for his white comrades, as do an Asian soldier named Franklin Roosevelt Matsu<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>in The Sixth Column and the one black character in Leigh Brackett’s story “The Vanishing Venusians” (1944). Other books tried resolutely to be “colorblind,” imagining a future in which race no longer was a factor; novels like Arthur C. Clarke’s Childhood’s End (1953) embodied the white liberal fantasy of a single black character functioning amiably and unselfconsciously in a predominantly white society.

A diligent reader in the 1950s, searching for science-fiction novels with something more than a patronizing image of black assimilation on white terms, could have turned up only a few texts in which race was acknowledged and allowed to shape the novel’s thematic and ideological concerns.10 Perhaps the most interesting example is a chapter in a book that Butler read in her youth, Bradbury’s Martian Chronicles (1950). Titled “Way in the Middle of the Air,” it is the story of a mass emigration of black Southerners to Mars in the year 2003. The Southern economy and the cultural assumptions of white supremacy are devastated when the entire black populace unites to ensure that all members of the community can pay their debts and arrive at the rocket base in time for the great exodus. Barefoot white boys report in astonishment this unanticipated strategy for a black utopia: “Them that has helps them that hasn’t! And that way they all get free!” In a speech that ironically skewers the myth of progress in African-American history, one petulant white man complains:

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t figure why they left now. With things lookin’ up. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>mean, every day they got more rights. What they want, anyway? Here’s the poll tax gone, and more and more states passin’ anti-lynchin’ bills, and all kinds of equal rights. What more they want? They make almost as good money as a white man, but there they go.11



“Way in the Middle of the Air” may be the single most incisive episode of black and white relations in science fiction by a white author. But its very rarity demonstrates how alien the territory of American science fiction in its so-called golden age, after the second world war, was for black readers and for aspiring writers like Octavia Butler. She has often observed, in response to questions about her nearly unique status as an African-American woman writing science fiction, that you have to be a reader before you can be a writer.

Butler’s formative years and her early career coincide with the years when American science fiction took down the “males only” sign over the door. Major expansions and redefinitions of the genre have been accomplished by such writers as Ursula K. LeGuin, Joanna Russ, Pamela Sargent, Alice Sheldon (writing under the pseudonym of James Tiptree, Jr.), Pamela Zoline, Marge Piercy, Joan Slonczewski, and Butler herself. The alien in much of the fiction by women has been not a monstrous figure from a distant planet but the invisible alien within modern, familiar, human society: the woman as alien, sometimes—more specifically—the black woman, the Chicana, the housewife, the lesbian, the woman in poverty, or the unmarried woman. Sheldon’s famous story “The Women Men Don’t See” (1974), about a mother and daughter who embark on a ship with extraterrestrials rather than remain unnoticed and unvalued on Earth, is a touchstone for the reconception of the old science-fictional representations of the human image. “Science fiction,” Butler writes, “has long treated people who might or might not exist—extraterrestrials. Unfortunately, however, many of the same science-fiction writers who started us thinking about the possibility of extraterrestrial life did nothing to make us think about here-at-home human variation.”12 As American women writers have abandoned the character types that predominated in science fiction for a richer plurality of human images, they have collectively written a new chapter in the genre’s history.

During the course of Butler’s career a parallel, although slender, chapter began to be written by African-American writers. When Kindred was first published in 1979, the only recognized African-American writer of science fiction and fantasy was Samuel R. Delany. As Kindred celebrates its silver anniversary the landscape is visibly changing. Steven Barnes, Jewelle Gomez, Nalo Hopkinson, Charles R. Saunders, and Tananarive Due have joined Delany and Butler. And the publication of Sheree Thomas’s important anthology Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora (2000) has showcased many contemporary black writers of nonrealist fiction while excavating a few surprises from the past, like W. E. B. Du Bois’s 1920 story “The Comet.” In the years since 1979 Butler has emerged as the commanding figure among African-American writers of science fiction and fantasy, having become the first (and so far only) science-fiction writer to win a prestigious five-year MacArthur Foundation Fellowship. Since the first Beacon edition of Kindred in 1988 there has been an explosion of critical interest in Butler. In 1988 it was possible to list nearly every critical article that had been published on her work, and most of that small body of material was published in obscure journals with tiny circulations. Today the list of works about Butler must be more selective, and the critical studies appear from major university and trade presses and in the premier journals of contemporary literature, African-American studies, and science-fiction studies. And the interest is not just academic, nor is it confined to science-fiction fans. In the spring of 2003 the city of Rochester, New York undertook its third annual event titled “If All of Rochester Read the Same Book.” An estimated 40,000 to 50,000 people read Kindred, discussed it in local reading groups, and for three days had a chance to meet Butler and talk with her about the book at her numerous appearances at universities, libraries, and bookstores.

In 1980 Charles Saunders, himself the author of African-based heroic and mythic fantasies, wrote a lament titled “Why Blacks Don’t Read Science Fiction.” Twenty years later he published a more sanguine sequel in the Dark Matter anthology: “Why Blacks Should Read (and Write) Science Fiction.” If any contemporary writer is responsible for Saunders’s change of heart, it is Octavia Butler. She has redrawn science fiction’s cultural boundaries and attracted new black readers—and potential writers—to this most distinctive of twentieth-century genres. More consistently than any other African-American author, she has deployed the genre’s conventions to tell stories with a political and sociological edge to them, stories that speak to issues, feelings, and historical truths arising out of African-American experience. In centering her fiction on women who lack power and suffer abuse but are committed to claiming power over their own lives and to exercising that power harshly when necessary, Butler has not merely used science fiction as a “feminist didactic,” in Beverly Friend’s terminology, but she has generated her fiction out of a black feminist aesthetic. Her novels pointedly expose various chauvinisms (sexual, racial, and cultural), are enriched by a historical consciousness that shapes the depiction of enslavement both in the real past and in imaginary pasts and futures, and enact struggles for personal freedom and cultural pluralism.

At the same time, Butler has been eager to avoid using her fiction as a soapbox. “Fiction writers can’t be too pedagogical or too polemical,” she told one interviewer.13 The route she pursues to her readers’ heads is through their guts and nerves, and that requires good storytelling, not just a good set of issues. Science fiction and fantasy are a richly metaphorical literature. Just as Mary Shelley in Frankenstein invented a monstrous child born from a male scientist’s imagination as a metaphor for the exclusion of women from acts of creation, and just as Wells’s Time Machine used hairy subterranean Morlocks and effete aboveground Elo<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>as metaphors for the upstairs-downstairs class divisions of Victorian England, so Butler has specialized in metaphors that dramatize the tyranny of one species or race or gender over another. In Kindred the most powerful metaphor is time travel itself. Traveling to the past is a dramatic means to make the past live, to get the reader to live imaginatively in the recreated past, to grasp it as a felt reality rather than merely a learned abstraction. The chapter titles Butler has given to each of the major episodes of Kindred further invite the reader to respond metaphorically: “The River,” “The Fire,” “The Fall,” “The Fight,” “The Storm,” and “The Rope.” As one commentator has observed, these chapter headings suggest something elemental, apocalyptic, archetypal about the events in the narrative.14 Kindred, after all, is not a documentary about racism, although the vividness of its invented details gives it a convincing “you are there” documentary power. But, finally, her work succeeds in engaging, terrifying, and moving readers because it is not fiction composed by agenda.

White writers, Butler has pointed out, have tended to include black characters in science fiction only to illustrate a problem or as signposts to advertise the author’s distaste for racism; black people in much science fiction are represented as “other.”15 All Butler’s fiction stands in quiet resistance to the notion that a black character in a science-fiction novel is there for a reason. In a Butler novel the black protagonist is there, like the mountain, because she is there. Although she does not hesitate to harness the power of fiction as fable to create striking analogies to the oppressive realities of our own present world, Butler also peoples her imagined worlds with black characters as a matter of course. While her frequent use of women as protagonists has brought attention to the black feminist aesthetic she practices, it is just as important to notice that there is always a critical mass of characters of color in her novels. One of the exciting features of Kindred is its attentiveness both to the exceptional situation of an isolated modern black woman in a household under slavery and to her complex social and psychological relationships within the community of slaves she joins. Despite the severe stresses under which they live, the slaves constitute a rich human society: Dana’s proud and vulnerable ancestor, Alice Greenwood; the mute housemaid, Carrie; Sarah, the cook who nurses old grievances while kneading bread dough; young Nigel, whom Dana teaches to read from a stolen primer; Sam James, the field hand who begs Dana to teach his brother and sister; Alice’s husband, Isaac, mutilated and sold to Mississipp<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>after a failed escape attempt; even Liza, the sewing woman, who betrays Dana to the master and is punished by the other slaves for her complicity with the white owners. Although the black community is persistently fractured by the sudden removal of its members through either the calculated strategy or the mere whim of their white controllers, that community always patches itself back together, drawing from its common suffering and anger a common strength. It is the white characters in the novel who seem odd, isolated, pathetic, alien.

The most problematic white man in Kindred is not the Maryland slave owner but the liberated, modern Californian married to Dana. Kevin Franklin is a good man. He loves Dana, loathes the chattel system that governs every feature of antebellum life in Maryland, and works with the Underground Railroad while he is trapped in the past. Yet he is by gender and race implicated in the supremacist culture. Throughout the novel Butler ingeniously suggests parallels between Rufus Weylin and Kevin Franklin: their facial expressions, their language, even after a time their accents merge in Dana’s mind so that she mistakes one for the other. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>gave her that husband to complicate her life,” Butler has commented, mischievously.16 One of the novel’s subtlest touches is in the chapter in which Dana is obliged to become Rufus Weylin’s secretary and handle his correspondence and bills; in 1976 Kevin had, unsuccessfully but still revealingly, tried to get his wife to type his manuscripts and write his letters for him. When Kevin and Dana are in nineteenth-century Maryland at the same time, the only way they can spend a night together is to make a public pretense of being master and slave, playing along with the prevailing belief that a black woman was the sexual property of a white man. But, as Dana realizes, the more often one plays such a role, the nearer the pretending comes to reality: “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt almost as though <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>really was doing something shameful, happily playing whore for my supposed owner. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>went away feeling uncomfortable, vaguely ashamed” (p. 97). And, she fears, Kevin begins to fit into the white, male, Southern routine too easily. Shuttling between the two white men in her life, she is aware not only of the blood link between herself and Rufus but of the double link of gender and race that unites Rufus and Kevin. The convergence of these two white men in Dana’s life not only dramatizes the ease with which even a “progressive” white man falls into the cultural pattern of dominance, but it suggests as well an uncanny synonymy of the words “husband” and “master.”17

The date of Dana’s final return to Los Angeles is July 4, 1976, the bicentennial of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence of the United States. In bringing the novel full circle from the protagonist’s birthday to the nation’s birthday, Butler deftly connects individual consciousness with social history and invites readers to meditate on the relationships between personal and political identities. What has been trivialized or sentimentalized—or erased—in the public celebrations of the past reemerges unvarnished in Dana’s homecoming on the fourth of July. Dana comes back to southern California with a truer understanding of African-American history than the sanitized versions offered by the popular media. Predictably, she scorns the image of the plantation derived from Gone with the Wind, but she also learns the inadequacy of even the best books as preparation for the firsthand experience of slavery. In her first trips to the past, Dana’s literacy, her education, and her historical knowledge sometimes lull her into a false sense of security. In one passage, she records her pleasure in the friendly atmosphere of the cookhouse where the slaves gather to eat and talk, usually free from white overseers. There she observes “a girl and boy, sitting on the floor eating with their fingers. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was glad to see them there because I’d read about kids their age being rounded up and fed from troughs like pigs. Not everywhere, apparently, not here” (p. 72). Although she does not name her literary source, Dana is recalling an episode from chapter 5 of Frederick Douglass’s 1845 Narrative (a work Butler read carefully during her research for Kindred) that describes feeding time at Colonel Lloyd’s plantation:

Our food was coarse corn meal boiled. This was called mush. It was put into a large wooden tray or trough, and set down upon the ground. The children were then called, like so many pigs, and like so many pigs they would come and devour the mush; some with oyster-shells, others with pieces of shingle, some with naked hands, and none with spoons.18



Mistakenly, because the food and the treatment of children are better than Douglass’s Narrative seemed to promise, Dana behaves as if the cookhouse is a sanctuary. That error in judgment leads to her first vicious flogging, when she is discovered teaching slave children to read. After her second whipping by Rufus Weylin’s father following her attempted flight from the plantation, she reflects angrily as another slave woman salves her wounds, “Nothing in my education or knowledge of the future had helped me to escape” (p. 177). Books had not taught her why so many slaves accepted their condition, nor had books defined the kind of bravery possible in the humiliating situation of being owned.

Films, Dana finds, are even less reliable guides to the past. Hollywood production values and the comfort of a theater seat insulate viewers from material purported to be historically accurate. Dana recalls witnessing the beating of a slave hunted out one night by white patrollers and how she crouched in the underbrush a few yards away from the man’s young daughter. The slave’s crime was being found in bed with his own free-born wife without having written permission from his owner:

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could literally smell his sweat, hear every ragged breath, every cry, every cut of the whip. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>could see his body jerking, convulsing, straining against the rope as his screaming went on and on. My stomach heaved, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had to force myself to stay where <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was and keep quiet. Why didn’t they stop!

“Please, Master,” the man begged. “For Godsake, Master, please …”

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>shut my eyes and tensed my muscles against an urge to vomit.

<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had seen people beaten on television and in the movies. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>had seen the too-red blood substitute streaked across their backs and heard their well-rehearsed screams. But <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>hadn’t lain nearby and smelled their sweat or heard them pleading and praying, shamed before their families and themselves. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>was probably less prepared for the reality than the child crying not far from me. (p. 36)



At such moments of first-person intensity, Kindred reveals its own literary kinship with the memoirs of ex-slaves published in the nineteenth century, for Butler’s greatest achievement in the novel is collapsing the genres of the fantastic travelogue and the slave narrative. She incorporates into Kindred both narrative strategies of the classic memoirs of former slaves and occasional deliberate verbal and situational echoes of those texts. In doing so she establishes a degree of authenticity and seriousness rarely attained by contemporary writers mining the conventions of the Wellsian time-travel story.

Reconstructing Womanhood, Hazel V. Carby’s feminist revision of the traditions of American black women’s writing, contrasts the image of the slave woman as victim in men’s slave memoirs with a very different image that emerges in such autobiographies as Harriet Jacobs’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Lucy Delany’s From the Darkness Cometh Light, and Mary Prince’s History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave. In those narratives, Carby argues, women define themselves as agents rather than as mere victims, and they record the brutality of their treatment by their owners in order to emphasize their resistance to victimization and their claim to freedom. Dana, Butler’s fictive autobiographer, extends that ideology and aesthetic of the slave woman’s memoir into the late-twentieth century. Much of Kindred is a record of endurance, but there are also numerous acts of heroism and humanity, culminating in the act of manslaughter in self-defense that finally liberates Dana, at terrible cost, from her tyrannical ancestor.19

Chained to her ancestral past by the genealogical link that requires her to keep the oppressive slave master alive until her own family is initiated, Dana works out the ethic of compromise that Harriet Jacobs tolerated to safeguard her children and herself. Despite her feelings of repugnance and shame, Jacobs compromised the sexual standards imposed on nineteenth-century women in order to maintain her central core of integrity and freedom of will; she reluctantly practiced a situational ethics dictated by the extreme circumstances that constrained the ethical choices of black women under slavery. As several commentators on Jacobs’s memoir have argued, the crucial sentence around which our understanding of Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl must be fashioned is her retrospective revision of the ethical norms that govern a woman’s choices and behaviors under systematic oppression: “Still, in looking back, calmly, on the events of my life, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>feel that the slave woman ought not to be judged by the same standard as others.”20 Butler’s Dana must move painfully toward a similar ethical relativism as she discovers that the moral choices of a late-twentieth-century black feminist cannot be exercised with impunity in the world of the slave state. At earlier stages in her experience in Maryland, as Dana tells Kevin, she is able to cling precariously to the ethical imperatives of her own time, though even then her perspective and choices must necessarily be fundamentally different from his:

You might be able to go through this whole experience as an observer…. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can understand that because most of the time, I’m still an observer. It’s protection. It’s nineteen seventy-six shielding and cushioning eighteen nineteen for me. But now and then … <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>can’t maintain the distance. I’m drawn all the way into eighteen nineteen, and <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>don’t know what to do. (p. 101)



The longer she remains in the nineteenth century, the thinner the protective cushioning becomes, until Dana finds herself five years later (in Maryland time) divided against herself, torn between absolute standards and pragmatic choices. The Dana of 1976 California finds it unthinkable that she would assist in the sexual exploitation of another black woman by a white man, but the Dana of 1824 Maryland finds herself in a moral trap. Rufus Weylin asks her to persuade Alice Greenwood, her own great-great-grandmother, to go to bed with him. Although she knows that her family tree is traceable to a child that Rufus fathers and Alice bears, Dana initially finds Rufus’s proposal repulsive, and she angrily rejects it. But when Rufus tells Dana that he will beat Alice—perhaps even beat her to death—if she refuses his advances and if Dana does not try to change Alice’s mind, she is caught in Harriet Jacobs’s dilemma: “He had all the low cunning of his class. No, <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>couldn’t refuse to help the girl—help her avoid at least some pain. But she wouldn’t think much of me for helping her this way. <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>didn’t think much of myself” (p. 164). The choice demanded by the situation will satisfy neither Dana’s own internal standards nor the larger feminist principle of sisterhood; she suffers the same shame that Jacobs felt, but she also adopts the compromise.

In the end, what may be most powerful and valuable for readers of Kindred is the simple reminder that all that history occurred not so very long ago. In foreshortening the distance between then and now, Butler focuses our attention on the continuity between past and present; the fantasy of traveling backwards in time becomes a lesson in historical realities. We may also be reminded that historical progress is never a sure thing. In one of her brief respites in 1976 between bouts of enslavement in the nineteenth century, Dana reads the memoirs of Jewish survivors of the Naz<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>death camps: “Stories of beatings, starvation, filth, disease, torture, every possible degradation. As though the Germans had been trying to do in only a few years what the Americans had worked at for nearly two hundred” (pp. 116-7). The systematic horrors of American slavery could have provided a model for that later programmed oppression and genocide.

Like Dana and Kevin, the reader of Kindred may discover a closer kinship with the characters and events of the antebellum South than we often care to admit. And just as Dana feels compelled in the novel’s epilogue to travel to contemporary Maryland and “touch solid evidence that those people existed” (p. 264), readers of this fantastic invention may also find their felt understanding of history enriched and deepened. In Kindred Octavia Butler has designed her own underground railroad between past and present whose terminus is the reawakened imagination of the reader.

Discussion Questions



1. Both Kevin and Dana know that they can’t change history. They say: “We’re in the middle of history. We surely can’t change it” (p. 100); and “It’s over. … There’s nothing you can do to change any of it now” (p. 264). What, then, is the purpose of Dana’s travels back to the antebellum South? Why must you, the reader, experience this journey with Dana?

2. How would the story have been different with a third-person narrator?

3. Many of the characters in Kindred resist classification. In what ways does Dana explode the slave stereotypes of the “house-nigger, the handkerchief-head, the female Uncle Tom” (p. 145)? In what ways does she transcend them?

4. Despite Dana’s determination to refuse the “mammy” role in the Weylin household, she finds herself caught by it: “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt like Sarah, cautioning” (p. 156). Others see her as the mammy as well: “‘You sound just like Sarah’” (p. 159). How, if at all, does Dana reconcile her conscious efforts with her behavior? How would you reconcile them?

5. “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>never realized how easily people could be trained to accept slavery.” Dana says this to Kevin when they have returned to the present and are discussing their experiences in the antebellum South. Do we also in the twenty-first century still have conditioned responses to slavery?

6. How do you think Butler confronts us with issues of difference in Kindred? How does she challenge us to consider boundaries of black/white, master/slave, husband/wife, past/present? What other differences does she convolute? Do you think such dichotomies are flexible? Artificial? Useful?

7. Compare Tom Weylin and Rufus Weylin. Is Rufus an improvement over his father? How, if at all, is Dana’s influence evident on the adult Rufus?

8. Of the slaves’ attitude toward Rufus, Dana observes, “Strangely, they seemed to like him, hold him in contempt, and fear him all at the same time” (p. 229). How can they feel these contradictory emotions? How would you feel toward Rufus if you were in their situation?

9. Compare Dana’s “professional” life in the present (i.e., her temporary work) with her life as a slave.

10. When Dana and Kevin return from the past together, she thinks: “<a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>felt as though <a href="" class="vl vx vp">I </a>were losing my place here in my own time. Rufus’s time was a sharper, stronger reality” (p. 191). Why would the twentieth century seem less vivid to Dana than the nineteenth century?

11. Dana loses her left arm as she emerges—for the last time in the novel—from the past. Why is this significant?

12. Kevin is stranded in the past for five years, while Dana is there for less than one year. Why did Butler feel Kevin needed to stay in the past so much longer than Dana? How have their experiences affected their relationship to each other and to the world around them?

13. A common trend in the time travels of science fiction assumes that one should not tamper with the past, lest you disrupt the present. Butler obviously ignores this theory and her characters continue to invade each other’s lives. How does this influence the movement of the narrative? How does it convolute the idea of cause and effect?

14. Dana finds herself caught in the middle of the relationship between Rufus and Alice. Why does Rufus use Dana to get to Alice? Does Alice also use Dana?

15. The needs and well-being of other residents of the plantation create a web of obligation that is difficult to navigate. Choose a specific incident and determine who holds power over whom; assess how it affects that situation.

16. Dana states: “It was that destructive single-minded love of his. He loved me. Not the way he loved Alice, thank God. He didn’t seem to want to sleep with me. But he wanted me around—someone to talk to, someone who would listen to him and care about what he said …” (p. 180). How does the relationship between Dana and Rufus develop? How does it change? What are the different levels of love portrayed in Kindred?

17. Discuss the ways in which the title encapsulates the relationships within the novel. Is it ironic? Literal? Metaphorical? What emphasis do we place on our own kinship? How does it compare with that of the novel?

18. Do you believe that Dana and Kevin’s story actually happened, or did they simply get caught up in the nostalgia of examining old papers and books? How would their situation’s significance have changed in Dana’s and Kevin’s lives if it had been imaginary? If it were merely nostalgia or an imagined situation, how would that change your perception of the antebellum South and the treatment of slaves? Would that make the events less significant?

19. Butler opens the novel with the conclusion of Dana’s time travels. The final pages of the book, however, make up an epilogue that once again demonstrates a linearly progressive movement of time. How does the epilogue serve to disrupt the rhythm of the narrative?

20. After returning from his years in the nineteenth century, Kevin had attained “a slight accent” (p. 190). Is this alteration symbolic of greater changes to come? How do you imagine Kevin and Dana’s relationship will progress following their reentry into life in 1976?
